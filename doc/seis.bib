@article{Monnereau2010,
	Abstract = {Hemispherical asymmetry is a prominent feature of Earth's inner core, but how this asymmetry relates to core growth is unknown. Based on multiple-scattering modeling of seismic velocity and attenuation measurements sampling the whole uppermost inner core, we propose that the growth of the solid core implies an eastward drift of the material, driven by crystallization in the Western Hemisphere and melting in the Eastern Hemisphere. This self-sustained translational motion generates an asymmetric distribution of sizes of iron crystals, which grow during their translation. The invoked dynamical process is still active today, which supports the idea of a young inner core.},

	Abstract = {We have assembled a data set of PKKPdf−PKKPbc (PKKPdf−bc) and PKPPKPdf-PKKPbc differential traveltimes. This data set is used to study the Earth's uppermost inner core in the western hemisphere. Data from the eastern Pacific are recorded at the Canadian Yellowknife array and travel through the inner core twice, once perpendicular to the Earth's rotation axis and once parallel to the rotation axis. Our polar paths sample a similar region to paths from the South Sandwich Islands to Alaska, an important path geometry for inner core anisotropy studies. Our data set has the potential to be an independent source of information on the structure of the inner core, and to be a good supplement to past PKP studies. Differential time residuals (relative to isotropic inner core models) of up to several seconds are found. The differential traveltimes show significant scatter (up to 6 s) making it difficult to attribute them to inner core anisotropy alone. Alternatively, strong heterogeneity in the inner core and along the mantle paths may contribute to observations.},

@article{Doornbos1974,
	Abstract = {Spectral ratios of short-period core phases with common source and receiver and with nearly the same ray paths in the mantle have been formed to derive a Q-structure for 1 Hz compressional waves in the inner core. Data from one large array (NORSAR) have been used to extract the relevant phases, including the pairs (PKIKP, PKiKP), (PKIKP, PKP(BC)), (PKIIKP, PKiKP), (PKIIKP, PKKP(BC)). An array is needed in particular to separate PKIKP and PKiKP and to identify PKIIKP. In forming the spectral ratios, techniques like spectraforming and instantaneous spectral analysis have been employed. The data have been inverted using a number of different velocity models. The essential features of the resulting Q-models are the same: Q rises from a value of about 200 near the inner core boundary to about 600 at 400 km depth penetration. Below 450 km depth the Q-structure is not well constrained, but probably is below a value of 2000. It is suggested that the temperature at the inner core boundary is close to the melting point of iron and that partial melting occurs in at least part of the inner core. The low Q-structure greatly affects the amplitudes of phases like PKIIKP and PKJKP. It is verified that PKIIKP is observable only in exceptional cases and arguments are presented that PKJKP is too small to be observed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Differential travel times and waveforms of {\{}PKIKP{\}} and {\{}PKiKP{\}} phases in the 129$\,^{\circ}$--141$\,^{\circ}$ distance range, deconvolved for the effects of source time functions and average mantle attenuation operators, are inverted for velocity and attenuation in the uppermost 80 km of the inner core, and the velocity gradient and attenuation in the lowermost 200 km of the outer core (F region). Results confirm degree-one velocity structure in the inner core whose fast and slow regions appear to be separated by transitions with a velocity contrast of about 1{\%}. Although attenuation in the inner core also exhibits degree-one pattern, a high attenuation region ( Q p − 1 = [ 0.002 , 0.0067 ] ) extends to the central Pacific, which has been previously considered a part of the western hemisphere characterized by slower velocity and lower attenuation. The rest of the inner core exhibits a positive correlation between velocity and attenuation as observed previously. An observed mantle-like relationship between velocity and attenuation in the central Pacific can be interpreted as originating from higher than average homologous temperature, consistent with a model of inner core solidification driven by outer core convection coupled to core--mantle boundary thermal heterogeneity. Alternative mechanisms, including differences in grain size and impurity concentration, and lateral differences in solidification rate might be required to explain the structure of the inner core. The F region velocity and attenuation are best explained by the AK135-F velocity model and Q p − 1 = [ 0 , 0.001 ] respectively.},

	Abstract = {The inner core has long been recognized as a part of the process by which fluid core convection is maintained and as an influence upon the magnetic field. Evidence from several seismological studies in recent years has mounted to indicate that the inner core has anisotropic velocities with large-scale (degree one) variation in strength of the differences from isotropy, and fine-scale (a few kilometres) inhomogeneities of structure. Indications have also been found of systematic changes in the travel time of seismic waves passing through the inner core {\^{a}} which have been interpreted as evidence that the inner core is rotating in an easterly direction, relative to the mantle, at a rate fast enough to be perceived on human timescales. The rate has been dismissed as too slow or physically impossible, but additional evidence has accumulated in support of what may be an emerging consensus that the inner core has a super-rotation of a few tenths of a degree per year.},

	Abstract = {The seismological exploration of the Earth's inner core has revealed unexpected and puzzling structural complexities. Its elastic anisotropy is now well established, and has been shown to vary spatially. There is a well defined hemispherical dichotomy in anisotropy and attenuation, and significant variations in the radial direction, with weaker anisotropy in the uppermost regions, and possibly different properties in an ``innermost inner core'' of radius 300--600{\&}{\#}xa0;km. Perhaps even more puzzling is the observation of a stably stratified layer at the base of the outer core, which has recently been proposed to result from melting of inner core material. If confirmed, the presence of this layer has major implications for our understanding of convection in the outer core. Inner core differential rotation with respect to the mantle remains controversial. We will review here recent progress in understanding the dynamics of the inner core. A number of different models have been proposed for the development of the inner core's structure and formation of the stable layer at the base of the outer core, and particular care will be taken to clarify under which conditions the proposed mechanisms can be active.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The structure of Earthʼs deep inner core has important implications for core evolution, since it is thought to be related to the early stages of core formation. Previous studies have suggested that there exists an innermost inner core with distinct anisotropy relative to the rest of the inner core. Using an extensive new data set of handpicked absolute travel time observations of the inner core phase PKIKP, we find that the data are best explained by variations in anisotropy between two hemispheres and do not require an innermost inner core. We demonstrate that observations of an innermost inner core are an artifact from averaging over lateral anisotropy variations. More significantly we show that hemispherical variations in anisotropy, previously only imaged in the upper inner core, continue to its centre. The eastern region has 0.5--1.5{\%} anisotropy, whereas the western region has 3.5--8.8{\%} anisotropy increasing with depth, with a slow direction at 57--61$\,^{\circ}$ to the Earthʼs rotation axis at all depths. Such anisotropy is consistent with models of aligned hcp or bcc iron aggregates.},

The back azimuth of this arrival is also consistent with predictions for PKJKP, as is the comparison with a pseudoliquid inner core model. Envelope modeling of the PKJKP waveform implies a shear velocity gradient with depth in the inner core that is slightly larger than that in the preliminary reference Earth model.},

Such variations indicate that Earth's ICB is irregular, with a combination of at least two scales of topography: a height variation of 14 km changing within a lateral distance of no more than 6 km, and a height variation of 4--8 km with a lateral length scale of 2--4 km. The characteristics of the ICB topography indicate that small-scale variations of temperature and/or core composition exist near the ICB, and/or the ICB topographic surface is being deformed by small-scale forces out of its thermocompositional equilibrium position and is metastable.},

By using seismograms with a predominant frequency of approximately 0.5{\&}{\#}xa0;Hz, 649 measurements are successfully collected, including 295 and 354 readings for the Eastern and Western hemispheres, respectively. Forward modeling with the reflectivity method suggests that the best-fit velocity structures in the Eastern and Western hemispheres are 0.5{\%} faster and 0.9{\%} slower, respectively, than an average structure at the inner core boundary (ICB), and that the velocity perturbations become linearly closer to the average with depth, finally coinciding with the average at 400{\&}{\#}xa0;km and 250{\&}{\#}xa0;km below the ICB, respectively, if ak135 is adopted for the structure above the ICB. In the Eastern hemisphere, the Q values in the uppermost 250{\&}{\#}xa0;km of the inner core and that in the range from 300 to 450{\&}{\#}xa0;km below the {\{}ICB{\}} are approximately 180 and 1000, respectively.

There are apparently no first-order discontinuities in the transition region from the outer to the inner core, as proposed earlier by other authors. The P velocity increase at the inner core boundary is 0.6--0.7 km/sec and thus considerably less than that in standard core models. In the outermost part of the inner core, there is a pronounced P velocity gradient. The S velocity below the inner core boundary is 3--4 km/sec, and thus this study gives another piece of purely seismological evidence for solidity of the inner core. Precursors to the main core phases in short-period records, which are frequently observed, are not explained by the proposed core model. Scattering hypotheses for the origin of these arrivals are compatible with the results of this study.},

	Abstract = {Constraining the topography of the inner-core boundary is important for studies of core{\^{a}}mantle coupling and the generation of the geodynamo. We present evidence for significant temporal variability in the amplitude of the inner core reflected phase PKiKP for an exceptionally high-quality earthquake doublet, observed postcritically at the short-period Yellowknife seismic array (YK), which occurred in the South Sandwich Islands within a 10-year interval (1993/2003). This observation, complemented by data from several other doublets, indicates the presence of topography at the inner-core boundary, with a horizontal wavelength on the order of 10 km. Such topography could be sustained by small-scale convection at the top of the inner core and is compatible with a rate of super rotation of the inner core of {\^{a}}0.1{\^{a}}0.15{\^{A}}$\,^{\circ}$ per year. In the absence of inner-core rotation, decadal scale temporal changes in the inner-core boundary topography would provide an upper bound on the viscosity at the top of the inner core.},

The zones may be topographic highs of the core-mantle boundary filled by light core sediments and might be important for variation of Earth's nutation and for convection of the outer core.},

Based on an extensive seismic data set, we propose the existence of an innermost inner core, with a radius of ∼300 km, that exhibits a distinct transverse isotropy relative to the bulk inner core. Specifically, within the innermost inner core, the slowest direction of wave propagation is ∼45$\,^{\circ}$ from the east-west direction. In contrast, the direction of the slowest wave propagation in the overlying inner core is east-west. The distinct anisotropy at the center of the Earth may represent fossil evidence of a unique early history of inner-core evolution.},

These modes show significant improvement in spectral fit when anelastic splitting function coefficients dst are introduced in addition to the elastic splitting function coefficients cst. We employ two separate anelastic treatments: (i) fully anelastic measurement, in which a complete set of anelastic splitting function coefficients is measured in addition to the elastic coefficients, and (ii) zonal anelastic measurement, in which anelasticity is only allowed in zonal splitting function coefficients. Together, these two approaches confirm that normal modes sensitive to the Earth's inner core resolve zonally dominant elastic and anelastic structures. The zonal dominance of anelasticity suggests that the inner core exhibit cylindrical attenuation anisotropy in addition to cylindrical velocity anisotropy. In particular, the zonally dominant anelasticity correlates with zonal elastic structure, that is, directions of higher velocity in the inner core also appear more attenuating.},

The observations provide compelling evidence for a seismic velocity discontinuity along north-south paths about 200 kilometers below the inner core boundary separating an isotropic upper inner core from an anisotropic lower inner core. The triplication associated with such a structure might be responsible for reported waveform complexity of short-period inner core arrivals along north-south paths and, if the depth of the boundary is laterally variable, their large travel-time variation.},

	Abstract = {Differential rotation of the Earth′s inner core has been predicted in some geodynamo models, and seismic studies over the past 15 yr have resolved rotation rates up to 1$\,^{\circ}$yr−1. Most previous seismic body-wave studies have focussed on South Sandwich Islands events recorded at station COL in Alaska. Here, we present a globally extended study into temporal variations in the inner core over some 25 yr, using PKPbc-PKPdf traveltime residuals. To test for differential rotation of the inner core, displacement of inner-core heterogeneities over time is sought. We introduce a new method of space-flattening to remove the effect of spatial variations on the time variations; this allows for the use of both polar, semi-equatorial and equatorial geometries. First, we reanalyse polar paths from South Sandwich Islands events to stations COL and INK in North America. These stations yield a differential rotation of the inner core at a rate of 0.12--0.38$\,^{\circ}$yr−1 in an eastward direction, in agreement with previous studies. However, station DAWY, which has a very similar path through the inner core as COL, yields at best a westward differential rotation of the inner core. Thus DAWY results are incompatible with the COL/INK inferred rotation. Secondly, earthquakes in the Aleutian Islands region, observed at BOSA and LBTB in southern Africa, exhibit temporal variations that are incompatible with the South Sandwich Islands-COL/INK inferred rotation rate. Thirdly, Kuril Islands events, recorded in South America at station BDF, yield inconclusive results. Finally, our final piece of evidence for the irreconcilability of differential inner-core rotation with global data comes from using earthquakes in the Vanuatu region, recorded at BCAO/BGCA in Central Africa, an equatorial geometry. These residuals resolve a westward inner-core rotation at a rate of 0.14$\,^{\circ}$yr−1, over the same time period that South Sandwich Islands events indicate an eastward rotation. As any rigid-body rotation should yield the same direction and rate independent of where the inner core is sampled, our results allow us to reject previously reported inner-core differential rotation rates of up to 0.1--0.5$\,^{\circ}$yr−1. Instead, our results suggest that structure in either the inner or the outer core is varying with time, over relatively short timescales and in ways that cannot be explained by, and do not support, a differentially rotating inner core.},

	Abstract = {The attenuation structure of the Earth's inner core, in combination with the velocity structure, provides much insight into its rheological and mineralogical properties. Here, we use a large data set of PKIKP/PKiKP amplitude ratios to derive attenuation models for the upper 100 km of the inner core, incorporating the effects of velocity models calculated using the same data set. We confirm that the upper inner core is hemispherical in attenuation, with stronger attenuation in the east hemisphere. We also observe, for the first time, a low attenuation upper layer of approximately 30 km thickness throughout the top of the inner core. Attenuation increases beneath this layer, and then gradually decreases going deeper into the inner core. Although the data appear to show attenuation anisotropy below 57.5 km depth in the west, we find that this can be explained by the velocity models alone, with no requirement for attenuation anisotropy in the upper inner core.},

@article{Cormier2007,
	Abstract = {Body waves interacting with the boundary of the solid inner core at narrow and wide angles of incidence provide independent constraints on a heterogeneous texture that may originate from the process of solidification. The equatorial, quasi-eastern hemisphere, of the uppermost 50--100 km of the inner core is characterized by a higher isotropic P wave velocity, lower Q$\alpha$'s inferred from PKIKP, and simpler PKiKP pulses compared to adjacent regions in the western hemisphere and polar latitudes. Compared to this region, the adjacent western (primarily Pacific) equatorial region is characterized by higher Q$\alpha$'s and a higher level of coda excitation following PKiKP. Lateral variations in both inner core Q$\alpha$ inferred from transmitted PKIKP and inner core heterogeneity inferred from the coda of reflected PKiKP can be modeled by lateral variations in a solidification fabric. In an actively crystallizing eastern equatorial region, characterized by upwelling flow in the outer core, fabrics that explain strong attenuation and the absence of attenuation and velocity anisotropy in short range (120$\,^{\circ}$--140$\,^{\circ}$) PKIKP and weak PKiKP codas have an anisotropy of scale lengths with longer scale lengths in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the inner core boundary. In less actively solidifying regions in the equatorial western hemisphere, longer scale lengths tend to be more parallel to the inner core boundary, consistent with outer core flow tangent to the inner core boundary or viscous shearing and recrystallization in the horizontal direction away from more actively crystallizing regions in the eastern hemisphere. This texture is less effective in attenuating PKIKP by forward scattering. Lateral variation in the equatorial western hemisphere between vertical versus horizontal oriented plate-like textures may explain lateral variations from weak to strongly back-scattered PKiKP coda and from strong to weak velocity and attenuation anisotropy in short range PKIKP.},

	Abstract = {Previous hypotheses concerning the cause of anomalous splitting in free oscillation spectra have led to models which are difficult to accept from the physical point of view - involving either substantial heterogeneity in the fluid outer core or large topographic variations in the core-mantle boundary and the inner core boundary and heterogeneity of several percent in inner core properties. Furthermore, other seismological evidence, some of it pre-existing and some of it very recently discovered, militates against these models. Within the framework of isotropic earth models there appears to be no acceptable explanation of the modal observations. Here we show that anisotropy in the inner core can produce an effect which is of the correct magnitude and which varies from mode to mode in approximately the observed manner. The data currently available are insufficient to objectively map the anisotropy, but the simple assumption of a constant elastic tensor which is invariant under rotations about the Earth's rotation axis (i.e. is transversely isotropic in the plane of the equator) matches well the gross features of the modal observations. This model does not entirely reconcile the modal data with traveltime observations; it is argued, however, that there exists an anisotropic model which will do so.},

Experiments show that heterogeneous boundary heating induces an eastward flow in the core, which, at a sufficiently large magnitude, develops into a large-scale spiral with a sharp front. The front separates the warm and cold regions in the core and includes a narrow jet flowing from the core-mantle boundary to the inner-core boundary. The existence of this front in the core may explain the Pacific quiet zone in the secular variation of the geomagnetic field and the longitudinally heterogeneous structure of the solid inner core.},

In this work, we search for evidence of IC discontinuities with reflection seismology techniques that use precritical PKiKP waveforms as empirical source pulses. Because any phase reflected from an IC discontinuity will have a small amplitude, we develop a technique combining source and receiver stacks in the search. We perform resolution tests where we compare the data with synthetic waveform stacks created using generalized ray theory and appropriate attenuation operators. Our results show that the IC lacks a significant (impedance jump {\textgreater}3 per cent), sharp (thickness {\textless}3--4 km), global discontinuity to depths of 800 km below the boundary with the outer core.},

	Abstract = {A technique for searching full model space that was applied to measurements of anomalously split normal modes showed a robust pattern of P-wave and S-wave anisotropy in the inner core. The parameter describing P-wave anisotropy changes sign around a radius of 400 kilometers, whereas S-wave anisotropy is small in the upper two-thirds of the inner core and becomes negative at greater depths. Our results agree with observed travel-time anomalies of rays traveling at epicentral distances varying from 150 degrees to 180 degrees. The models may be explained by progressively tilted hexagonal close-packed iron in the upper half of the inner core and could suggest a different iron phase in the center.},

Here we present observations of the phases pPKJKP and SKJKP for the Flores Sea event of 1996 June 17. The observations support the value of approximately 3.6 km s(-1) for the inner core shear wave velocity and open up new possibilities for exploring the anisotropic structure and the attenuation properties of the inner core. The analysis and validation of the observation is based on a new method that can be used in the search for and identification of inner core shear waves. In this method normal mode synthetics for a solid inner core are compared with those for a fluid inner core. It is only by such comparisons that it is possible to be certain that inner core shear waves, rather than interferences of other phases, are responsible for observed energy maxima in stacked seismic records.},

	Abstract = {The determination of the inner-core boundary structure is key to understanding the mechanisms of inner-core growth, iron solidification and anisotropy formation in the inner core. A waveform inversion of a worldwide data set of PKIKP and PKiKP core phases is performed to investigate the velocity and the attenuation structure of this region. The data set is chosen to sample the top 50 km of the inner core. Two inversion methods combining time and frequency domain observations are presented. Synthetic tests are performed in order to evaluate the resolution and the confidence intervals of the model parameters. The attenuation of P waves in the uppermost inner core is poorly resolved but appears to be high (Q {\textless} 100). The uppermost inner-core interface is divided into two regions: a region extending from 180{\{}degrees{\}}W to 60{\{}degrees{\}}E and characterized by negative P-wave velocity perturbations (dV/V {\textless} 0 per cent), and a region extending from 60{\{}degrees{\}}E to 180{\{}degrees{\}}E and characterized by positive P-wave velocity perturbations (dV/V [{\~{}}]1 per cent). The results of the inversion do not favour the presence of transverse isotropy aligned along the spin axis of the Earth in the uppermost inner core for these two regions. However, these regions are correlated with those where large-scale variations of the inner-core anisotropy have been determined previously in the deeper inner core, 100 km beneath the inner-core boundary.},

@article{Deguen2007,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested about 20 years ago that the liquid close to the inner core boundary (ICB) is supercooled and that a sizable mushy layer has developed during the growth of the inner core. The morphological instability of the liquid--solid interface which usually results in the formation of a mushy zone has been intensively studied in metallurgy, but the freezing of the inner core occurs in very unusual conditions: the growth rate is very small, and the pressure gradient has a key role, the newly formed solid being hotter than the adjacent liquid. We investigate the linear stability of a solidification front under such conditions, pointing out the destabilizing role of the thermal and solutal fields, and the stabilizing role of the pressure gradient. The main consequence of the very small solidification rate is the importance of advective transport of solute in liquid, which tends to remove light solute from the vicinity of the ICB and to suppress supercooling, thus acting against the destabilization of the solidification front. For plausible phase diagrams of the core mixture, we nevertheless found that the ICB is likely to be morphologically unstable, and that a mushy zone might have developed at the ICB. The thermodynamic thickness of the resulting mushy zone can be significant, from ∼100 km to the entire inner core radius, depending on the phase diagram of the core mixture. However, such a thick mushy zone is predicted to collapse under its own weight, on a much smaller length scale (≲1 km). We estimate that the interdendritic spacing is probably smaller than a few tens of meter, and possibly only a few meters.},

@article{Deguen2011,
	Abstract = {We propose an extension of the model by Yoshida et al., 1996 where deformation in the inner core is forced by preferential growth in the equatorial belt, by taking into account the presence of a stable compositional stratification. Stratification inhibits vertical motion, imposes a flow parallel to isodensity surfaces, and concentrates most deformation in a shallow shear layer of thickness ∼B−1/5, where B is the dimensionless buoyancy number. The localization of the flow results in large strain rates and enables the development of a strong alignment of iron crystals in the upper inner core. We couple our dynamical model with a numerical model of texture development and compute the time evolution of the lattice preferred orientation of different samples in the inner core. With sufficient stratification, texturing is significant in the uppermost inner core. In contrast, the deeper inner core is unaffected by any flow and may preserve a fossil texture. We investigate the effect of an initial texture resulting from solidification texturing at the ICB. In the present inner core, the deformation rate in the shallow shear layer is large and can significantly alter the solidification texturing, but the solidification texture acquired early in the inner core history can be preserved in the deeper part. Using elastic constants from ab initio calculations, we predict different maps of anisotropy in the modern inner core. A model with both solidification texturing and subsequent deformation in a stratified inner core produces a global anisotropy in reasonable agreement with seismological observations.},

	Abstract = {Calculations for short-period body waves that interact with an inner-outer core transition of finite thickness are described. This involves development of a hybrid full wave-reflectivity algorithm which is used to calculate synthetic seismograms for earth models with various transition thicknesses. The numerical results indicate that the frequency content of reflected short-period PKiKP waveforms observed at distances less than 40 deg is very sensitive to the thickness of the transition zone. Comparison with published data in this distance range indicates that the inner-core transition must be less than 5 km thick. In the distance range 60-90 deg effective decoupling of short-period PKiKP and PKJKP is achieved for transition zones as thin as 3 km, resulting in substantial distortion of the PKiKP waveform. PKIKP + PKiKP waveforms in the distance range 120-130 deg are not as sensitive to the detailed properties of the transition, but the signal quality is good enough to constrain the transition thickness to be less than 10 km.},

	Abstract = {Short-period seismograms are synthesized for PKP phases in anelastic Earth models. The synthetics were constructed using a synthetic technique valid at grazing incidence, a source-time function appropriate for deep-focus earthquakes, and an instrument response for either a short-period WWSSN or SRO seismograph. The agreement between predicted and observed amplitudes and spectral ratios requires neither a low-Q$\alpha$ zone at 0.2--2 Hz nor a low or negative P-velocity gradient at the bottom of the outer core. Thin low-Q$\alpha$ zones beneath the inner core boundary fit spectral ratio data that sample the upper 200 km of the inner core but fail to fit data that sample the lower inner core. Only a model having Q$\alpha$−1 ϵ[0.003, 0.004] at 0.2--2 Hz, nearly constant with depth in the inner core, satisfies all of the spectral ratio and amplitude data. The assumption of a bulk viscosity of 10-103 Pa s for the liquid phase of a partially molten inner core combined with the observation of low shear attenuation in the inner core at frequencies less than 0.005 Hz limit the physical parameters associated with two possible attenuation mechanisms: (1) fluid flow and viscous relaxation due to ellipsoidally shaped inclusions of melt, and (2) the solid-liquid phase transformation induced by the stress change during the passage of a seismic wave. Both mechanisms require an order of 0.1{\%} partial melt to reproduce the observed Q$\alpha$−1. In the outer core, the time constant of the mechanism of phase transformation is predicted to be 104--106 s. Confirmation of small shear attenuation in the inner core in the frequency band of seismic body waves would favor the mechanism of phase transformation.},

	Abstract = {The seismic phase PKiKP, reflected from the inner core, and its coda give information on the short scale heterogeneities at and below the inner core boundary (ICB) of the Earth. We have collected PKiKP recorded at short distances ({\textless}45$\,^{\circ}$) at broadband stations in Australia and at the Warramunga seismic array (WRA). Despite potential complications from a dual-passage through D″, PKiKP is frequently observed on single traces in the frequency band 1--5Hz. PKiKP usually has a sharp onset, but sometimes its waveforms have multiple pulses separated by times of the order of 1s. At WRA, the coda of PKiKP initially decays very rapidly after the main pulse. Thereafter, its amplitude is nearly constant and more than three times smaller than PKiKP with duration longer than 200s. Our observations differ from those of [Nature 404 (2000) 273--275], at rather greater distances, who found that the coda is larger than PKiKP and increases slowly. We suggest that the PKiKP coda is generated near the inner core boundary by complex reverberation effects, rather than scattering through the volume of the inner core.},

@article{Wu1985,
	Abstract = {Elastic wave scattering by a general elastic heterogeneity having slightly different density and elastic constants from the surrounding medium is formulated using the equivalent source method and Born approximation. In the low-frequency range (Rayleigh scattering) the scattered field by an arbitrary heterogeneity having an arbitrary variation of density and elastic constants can be equated to a radiation field from a point source composed of a unidirectional force proportional to the density contrast between the heterogeneity and the medium, and a force moment tensor proportional to the contrasts of elastic constant. It is also shown that the scattered field can be decomposed into an 'impedance-type' field, which has a main lobe in the backscattering direction and no scattering in the exact forward direction, and a 'velocity type' scattered field, which has a main lobe in the forward scattering direction and no scattering in the exact backward direction. For Mie scattering we show that the scattered far field is a product of two factors: (1) elastic Rayleigh scattering of a unit volume, and (2) a scalar wave scattering factor for the parameter variation function of the heterogeneity which we call 'volume factor.' For the latter we derive the analytic expressions for a uniform sphere and for a Gaussian heterogeneity. We show the relations between volume factors and the 3-D Fourier transform (or 1-D Fourier transform in the case of spherical symmetry) of the parameter variations of the heterogeneity. The scattering spatial pattern varies depending upon various combinations of density and elastic-constant perturbations. Some examples of scattering pattern are given to show the general characteristics of the elastic wave scattering.},

	Abstract = {High-frequency reflection and refraction seismograms for laterally variable multi-layered elastic media are computed by using the frequency domain elastic Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (KH) theory of Frazer and Sen. Both source and receiver wavefields are expanded in series of generalized rays and then elastic (KH) theory is applied to determine the coupling between each source ray and each receiver ray at each interface. The motion at the receiver is given as a series of integrals, one for each generalized ray. We use geometrical optics and plane wave reflection and transmission coefficients for rapid evaluation of the integrand. When the source or the receiver ray field has caustics on the surface of integration geometrical ray theory breaks down and this gives rise to singularities in the KH integrand. We repair this using methods suggested by Frazer and Sen. Examples of reflection seismograms for 2-D structures computed by elastic KH theory are shown. Those for a vertical fault scarp structure are compared with the seismograms obtained by physical modelling. Then OBS data obtained from the mid-America trench offshore Guatemala area are analysed by computing KH synthetics for a velocity model that has been proposed for that area. Our analysis indicates the existence of a small low-velocity zone off the trench axis. No head wave arrivals are obtained in our KH synthetics since we do not consider multiple interactions of a ray with an interface. The nearly discontinuous behaviour of elastic R/T coefficients near the critical angle causes small spurious phases which arrive later than the correct arrivals.},

	Abstract = {3D Kirchhoff theory is used to calculate synthetic short-period (1 s) seismograms for the reflection PcP at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The CMB models have sinusoidal topography of wavelength L and amplitude E. E values of 0.5 and 1 km are assumed, in agreement with results of PKP-precursor studies, and L ranges from 600 to 10 km. The corresponding PcP amplitude-distance curves in the range 22-81$\,^{\circ}$ are compared with the smooth curve for a spherical CMB (E = 0). For L {\textgreater}= 100 km pronounced amplitude variations around the reference curve occur, corresponding to PcP focusing by lows and defocusing by highs of the CMB. For L {\textless}= 50 km the amplitude curve is smooth again, but with lower values than on the reference curve: part of the energy is deflected from the specular PcP ray of the reference model by diffuse reflection. These results are in qualitative agreement with seismological observations of (1) strong scatter in PcP amplitudes and (2) generally very low PcP amplitudes at distances beyond 70$\,^{\circ}$},

	Abstract = {An automatic phase picker is useful for quickly identifying and timing phase arrivals in large seismic data bases. We have developed an automatic phase picker that is sensitive to small changes in amplitude and applied it to over 7 yr of global data distributed by the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC). Our phase-picking algorithm is based on a short-term-average to long-term-average ratio (STA/LTA) taken along an envelope function generated from the seismogram. The algorithm returns arrival times and corresponding pick qualities. The procedure requires few input parameters and is easily adapted to various types of data. We produce global travel-time plots from both high-frequency (20- or 40-Hz sample rate) and low-frequency (1-Hz sample rate) data. These plots clearly image the predominant high- and low-frequency phases in the NEIC data base. Picks made from the long-period seismograms are less precise, but they reveal far more phase arrivals than the short-period picks. A number of phases resulting from reflections and phase conversions at upper mantle discontinuities can be identified in the low-frequency picks; however, a search of the short-period picks for upper mantle discontinuity phases, between P and PP and prior to P′P′, has so far been unsuccessful. In the long-period S and SS picks, we observe a discrepancy in SV and SH travel times, a possible result of upper mantle anisotropy. To check the accuracy and consistency of our algorithm, we present comparisons between hand-picked times and automatic-picked times for identical seismograms. Travel-time residuals from the short-period automatic picks and data reported to the International Seismological Centre (ISC) picks exhibit a comparable amount of scatter. Histograms of the ISC residuals and automatic-pick residuals are similar in shape and width for P and PcP. These observations suggest that human picking errors are not a major contributor to the scatter observed in ISC travel times, although direct comparisons between ISC reported picks and automatic picks on particular seismograms occasionally identify operator mispicks.},

Otherwise, the anomalies are constraints on the (unknown) aspherical perturbations. We are led to an inverse problem in either case.Using recently derived models of the Earth we present calculations of the effect of ellipticity. If the effect of focal depth is neglected in the calculations, then mislocations in both epicentre and origin time can result. Differences between our calculations and those predicted by the approximate formula $\delta$t = (h+H)f($\Delta$) are as large as 0--25 s for P at 90$\,^{\circ}$. Nowadays, seismologists are prone to attach significance to anomalies as small as 0.10 s.

	Abstract = {Over the last three years, a major international effort has been made by the Sub-Commission on Earthquake Algorithms of the International Association of Seismology and the Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI) to generate new global traveltime tables for seismic phases to update the tables of Jeffreys {\&} Bullen (1940). The new tables are specifically designed for convenient computational use, with high-accuracy interpolation in both depth and range. The new iasp91 traveltime tables are derived from a radially stratified velocity model which has been constructed so that the times for the major seismic phases are consistent with the reported times for events in the catalogue of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) for the period 1964--1987. The baseline for the P-wave traveltimes in the iasp91 model has been adjusted to provide only a small bias in origin time for well-constrained events at the main nuclear testing sites around the world.For P-waves at teleseismic distances, the new tables are about 0.7s slower than the 1968 P-tables (Herrin 1968) and on average about 1.8-1.9 s faster than the Jeffreys {\&} Bullen (1940) tables. For S-waves the teleseismic times lie between those of the JB tables and the results of Randall (1971).Because the times for all phases are derived from the same velocity model, there is complete consistency between the traveltimes for different phases at different focal depths. The calculation scheme adopted for the new iasp91 tables is that proposed by Buland {\&} Chapman (1983). Tables of delay time as a function of slowness are stored for each traveltime branch, and interpolated using a specially designed tau spline which takes care of square-root singularities in the derivative of the traveltime curve at certain critical slownesses. With this representation, once the source depth is specified, it is straightforward to find the traveltime explicitly for a given epicentral distance. The computational cost is no higher than a conventional look-up table, but there is increased accuracy in constructing the traveltimes for a source at arbitrary depth. A further advantage over standard tables is that exactly the same procedure can be used for each phase. For a given source depth, it is therefore possible to generate very rapidly a comprehensive list of traveltimes and associated derivatives for the main seismic phases which could be observed at a given epicentral distance.},

	Abstract = {A new method is presented for calculating synthetic seismograms and their partial derivatives for laterally and vertically heterogeneous media with arbitrary natural boundary conditions. The formulation is derived by adding appropriate surface integrals to the weak form (Galerkin formulation) of the elastic equation of motion to enforce the natural boundary and continuity conditions, and inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Results applicable to media consisting of a combination of fluid and solid regions are presented. The method is called the Direct Solution Method (DSM) (Geller et al. 1990c) because the synthetic seismograms and partial derivatives are computed directly by solving a system of linear equations. In contrast, almost all previous applications of Galerkin methods in seismology have first computed the modes of free oscillation, and only then computed the synthetic seismograms and partial derivatives by summing the modes. As an example of the application of our method, we calculate synthetic seismograms for heterogeneous media which are terminated at the bottom by a thin homogeneous layer with a radiation (energy-absorbing) boundary condition.This method is well suited to computing the quantities necessary to perform linearized inversion for earth structure with respect to a laterally heterogeneous earth model (Geller {\&} Hara 1993). It thus becomes possible to formulate iterative linearized waveform inversion for laterally heterogeneous earth structure on a local and regional scale following the same basic approach used by Hara, Tsuboi {\&} Geller (1993) to invert waveform data for global laterally heterogeneous structure.},

	Abstract = {We derive modified matrix operators that minimize the numerical error of solutions of the discretized elastic equation of motion. The criterion for obtaining the modified matrix operators is that the net error of the discretized equation of motion must be approximately equal to zero whenever the operand is an eigenfunction and the frequency is equal to the corresponding eigenfrequency. As it is not necessary to know the explicit values of the eigensolutions, our approach can be applied to arbitrarily heterogeneous media. In this paper we primarily consider frequency domain solutions calculated using the direct solution method (DSM) (Geller et al. 1990; Hara, Tsuboi {\&} Geller 1991; Geller {\&} Ohminato 1994). We present explicit formulations of the modified operators and numerical examples for P-SV and SH wave propagation in laterally homogeneous, isotropic media. The numerical solutions obtained using the modified operators are about 30 times more accurate than those obtained using the unmodified operators for the same CPU time. Our methods are readily applicable to problems in spherical coordinates or involving laterally heterogeneous media, as well as to time-domain solutions. It should also be possible to apply the methods of this paper to numerical methods other than the DSM.},

The Kirchhoff response is calculated by discretizing the surface, specifying simple point sources on each element of the surface, and summing the contribution from the elements. The results of the method are compared to those of an asymptotic, first motion approximation of the analytical solution of SH-waves impinging on a rigid sphere. The agreement between the results of the two methods is excellent for source and receiver distances which are large compared to the radius of the sphere. The method is applied to the calculations of reflections from mountain topography and a planar surface with an aperture. The phase shifts of pulses are consistent with optics; the amplitudes are not. The method does predict frequency dependence of the scattered amplitudes. Calculations are presented to model spall which produce travel-time and amplitude anomalies consistent with observations from nuclear blasts.},

@article{Richards1973,
	Abstract = {The known failure of classical ray theory at caustics has led to a reconsideration of displacement (in the frequency domain), expressed as an integral over ray parameter p. The integrand contains saddle-points on the real p-axis which correspond to rays for the associated physical problem, and it is shown here that direct computation of the complex integral is still straightforward, even when two saddle-points (rays) have coalesced to form a caustic. WKBJ theory is still usable for the vertical wave-functions, but one may avoid both the Taylor series expansion for the phase, and the steepest-descents approximation. Attention is first directed towards the PKKP caustic near 119$\,^{\circ}$, to calculations of both amplitude and the phase slowness (dT/d$\Delta$) as a function of frequency, and to a criticism of some uses of plane wave reflection coefficients across the core-mantle boundary. It is then shown that short-period P-wave energy is efficiently tunnelled into and out of the Earth's core, from body waves having their turning point just above the core-mantle boundary. This provides an explanation for observations of multiply reflected core phases, PmKP with m {\textgreater} 2, which are found usually at distances beyond the cutoff one would expect from requiring real angles of incidence (≤ 90$\,^{\circ}$) from mantle to core. To obtain body wave pulse shapes in the time domain, a method is described which appears to offer some strong advantages over Cagniard-de Hoop inversion.},

@article{Houser2008,
	Abstract = {We present a new technique for the efficient measurement of the traveltimes of long period body wave phases. The technique is based on the fact that all arrivals of a particular seismic phase are remarkably similar in shape for a single event. This allows the application of cross-correlation techniques that are usually used in a regional context to measure precise global differential times. The analysis is enhanced by the inclusion of a clustering algorithm that automatically clusters waveforms by their degree of similarity. This allows the algorithm to discriminate against unusual or distorted waveforms and makes for an extremely efficient measurement technique.This technique can be applied to any seismic phase that is observed over a reasonably large distance range. Here, we present the results of applying the algorithm to the long-period channels of all data archived at the IRIS DMC from 1976 to 2005 for the seismic phases S and P (from 23$\,^{\circ}$ to 100$\,^{\circ}$) and SS and PP (from 50$\,^{\circ}$ to 170$\,^{\circ}$). The resulting large data sets are inverted along with existing surface wave and updated differential traveltime measurements for new mantle models of S and P velocity. The resolution of the new model is enhanced, particularly, in the mid-mantle where SS and PP turn. We find that slow anomalies in the central Pacific and Africa extend from the core--mantle boundary to the upper mantle, but their direct connection to surface hotspots is beyond our resolution. Furthermore, we find that fast anomalies that are likely associated with subducting slabs disappear between 1700 and 2500 km, and thus are not continuous features from the upper to lower mantle despite our extensive coverage and high resolution of the mid-mantle.},

	Abstract = {An approximate analysis is given for the likely fractional lateral density variations ($\delta$$\rho$/$\rho$) in the outer core, caused by large scale-length fluid dynamical processes. It is first shown that fractional density and fractional seismic velocity variations are probably comparable, so that fluid dynamic arguments have relevance to seismic data. In regions of nearly neutral stability in the outer core, an analysis of convective vigour indicates an upper bound of $\delta$$\rho$/$\rho$≲10−8. If the outer core possesses one or more layers of strong static stability then stationary contributions to $\delta$$\rho$ can be larger, if they are associated with axisymmetric (m = 0) harmonics, because of stabilizing zonal winds. Baroclinic instabilities nevertheless limit $\delta$$\rho$/$\rho$≲ 10−6 but may not exist if the static stability is sufficiently large. Shear instabilities always limit $\delta$$\rho$/$\rho$≲ 10−4. Magnetic field effects suggest comparable or more stringent upper bounds. It is concluded that scientists undertaking analysis of the Earth's geoid or seismic travel times or normal modes can safely assume that there are negligible lateral variations in the outer core.},

A compilation of the PKiKP subcritical travel times obtained from previous studies has also been carried out. In the second part, differential PKiKP-PcP travel times at short distances ($\Delta${\textless}45$\,^{\circ}$) are used to determine the inner core ellipticity and mean radius, subject to hypotheses on the equilibrium figure of the liquid core and the topography of the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The coherence of the PKiKP-PcP travel-time residuals is increased when Morelli {\&} Dziewonski's CMB topography is taken into account. According to various hypotheses, the values obtained for the ellipticity range from (1.9$\pm$2.2)×10−3 to (5.6$\pm$1.7)×10−3. This denotes a small inner core flattening corresponding to a decrease of the polar radius from (1.6$\pm$1.8) to (5.0$\pm$1.5) km with respect to a spherical inner core. The preferred solutions which involve the CMB topography, are consistent with the ellipticity 2.43×10−3 deduced from hydrostatic equilibrium of a rotating inner core. The last part of the paper concerns the amplitude variations of PKiKP. The amplitude ratio PKiKP/PcP at short distances ($\Delta${\textless}45$\,^{\circ}$) is used to constrain the density jump $\delta$$\rho$ at the inner core boundary. $\delta$$\rho$ values of 1.35--1.66 g cm−3 are obtained for a quality factor in the liquid core ranging from 10 000 to infinity. These values, as well as a possible stratification in the inner core, are in favour of an inner core composition which is not pure iron.},

	Abstract = {Because the attenuation of seismic waves is sensitive to variations in temperature and to partial melting, the mapping of seismic Q beneath the mid-ocean ridge systems is a useful tool to outline boundaries between lithosphere and asthenosphere and to constrain the mechanics of the intrusion process. Our approach is to measure the differential attenuation of long-period shear waves, using a spectral ratio technique, from earthquakes on the ridge and to look for variations in attenuation with propagation direction. We correct for propagation distance and, where known, the upper mantle attenuation beneath the receiving stations. The azimuthal dependence of attenuation of S waves from an earthquake offset from the ridge axis on a transform fault indicates the existence of a low-Q zone, no wider than 100 km and confined to depths shallower than about 50 to 150 km, beneath the crest of the mid-Atlantic ridge. The absence of appreciable azimuthal variation in shear wave attenuation for an earthquake on the ridge crest suggests that the low-Q zone is at least 50 km wide. Q within such a zone must be 10 or less for long-period S waves. The most likely explanation of such a low-Q zone of limited spatial extent and with sharply defined boundaries is that the zone is a region of extensive partial melting, probably at temperatures in excess of the anhydrous solidus of mantle material. Such a region of large melt concentration is consistent with the chemistry of rocks from the mid-ocean ridges and with models of the temperature field derived from numerical calculations of flow beneath spreading centers.},

	Abstract = {A model of Q−1 based on Walsh's theory for attenuation in partially melted rock is proposed for the upper mantle of western North America. The asthenosphere (or low-Q zone), in which attenuation is attributed to a superposition of thermally activated relaxation processes, is 300 km thick in the model and must be vertically inhomogeneous. The lithosphere (or high-Q lid) is 60 km thick. The model is consistent with a wide assortment of attenuation and velocity data, in all spanning approximately three decades in frequency. Both the shear modulus and Q−1 for shear waves are frequency dependent in the asthenosphere. The viscosity and volume concentration of melt can be estimated from the relaxation parameters. Further, if lateral changes in these parameters, determined from the differential attenuation and travel-time delays of P and S waves, are attributed to horizontal temperature variations, then these temperature differences in the asthenosphere need be no larger than 100 to 200$\,^{\circ}$K at a depth of several hundred kilometers. The highest temperatures determined in this fashion are beneath the Rocky Mountain and Pacific border regions.},

	Abstract = {The general theory of viscoelasticity, which accounts for elastic as well as anelastic linear behavior of materials, predicts that two types of S waves propagate in anelastic earth materials. The particle motion for an inhomogeneous plane S wave of type I is elliptical in the plane defined by the directions of propagation and attenuation, while the particle motion for an inhomogeneous plane S wave of type II is linear perpendicular to this plane. The general theory predicts that an S-wave incident upon a plane boundary perpendicular to the plane defined by the directions of propagation and attenuation generates S waves only of the same type. General characteristics of the type-II S waves reflected and refracted at plane anelastic boundaries are:(a) velocities and maximum attenuations which depend on the angle of incidence and frequency,(b) maximum energy flow at a different velocity and in a different direction than phase propagation,(c) energy flow across the boundary due to interaction of the incident and reflected waves.The general theory predicts these characteristics for the waves whenever a plane type-II S wave interacts with a plane anelastic boundary such as a soil-bedrock, crust-mantle, or core-mantle interface. None of these characteristics are predicted for the plane SH waves described by elasticity theory.},

	Abstract = {The reflection and transmission coefficients for vertical incidence can be very closely approximated by computing the direct-reflected and the direct-transmitted portion for transition layers, and letting the thickness approach zero. The same procedure can then be applied to the general case of oblique incidence, which yields approximate values of the respective coefficients, including those of the converted waves. The approximate values compare well with the exact values calculated by Muskat and Meres (1940).These approximations might be adequate for all cases occurring in reflection seismic prospecting. They can also be used, possibly even more profitably, for the derivation of some rules governing the reflection process. The influence of Poisson's ratio can be read more or less directly from the approximate formulas. All converted waves depend primarily on the ratio of the shear velocities.},

@article{JGR:JGR13301,
	Abstract = {Attempts to study the core-mantle boundary have traditionally been frustrated by the large scattered amplitude ratios of PcP to P phases. An analysis of these phases at the Large-Aperture Seismic Array (Lasa) shows that two sources of severe scattering are the crust and upper mantle structure under the receiver and the low-velocity zone near the source. Measured amplitudes at the 21 Lasa subarray sites show that P and PcP amplitude patterns from the same event are generally uncorrelated. As a result, PcP/P amplitude ratios have large standard deviations across Lasa, typically 50{\%} of the mean PcP/P ratios. However, P patterns for two events several degrees apart are highly correlated, as are PcP patterns. Thus amplitude fluctuations across Lasa are caused by near-receiver scattering rather than deep mantle or core structure. Steered beams were formed of P and PcP phases for 35 events in the distance range 40$\,^{\circ}$--84$\,^{\circ}$ with depths from 0 to 609 km. The PcP/P ratios obtained from these beams show a clear trend from ∼0.4 at a depth of 0 km for explosion data to ∼0.15 at depths greater than 200 km for all distances. This depth effect cannot be explained by laterally homogeneous low-Q models of the upper mantle. When the events are normalized to Lasa mb = 6.0, the resulting PcP amplitudes show no clear depth dependence. It is thus suggested that variations in P amplitude cause most of the scatter in PcP/P ratios obtained from beamed data. A horizontally laminated low-velocity zone consisting of alternating hard and soft layers could produce the observed variation of PcP/P amplitude ratios with depth, although other scattering mechanisms cannot be eliminated.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of {\{}ISC{\}} phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2--4{\%}, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.},

	Abstract = {Synthetic seismograms, computed for realistic, horizontally stratified media, are now routinely used as an aid to seismic interpretation. This paper reviews the theoretical background to these methods and presents comparisons of the two popular algorithms, reflectivity and WKBJ seismograms, for a variety of earth models. The transformed wave equations are developed from the equations for a spherical, gravitating medium in a symmetric form suitable for body wave calculations. Four methods of solving these equations in general, inhomogeneous layers are described: the WKBJ and Langer asymptotic expansions and the WKBJ and Langer iterative solutions. Together with the earth-flattening transformation and the ray expansion, transformed solutions for body waves can then be obtained for realistic layered media. Four methods of inverting the frequency and wave number transformations are also described: the real and complex spectral and slowness methods. Although realistic seismic models are normally sufficiently complicated that numerical calculations are essential, before proceeding with numerical comparisons we have included a review of the canonical signals included in body wave seismograms. These analytic results for direct rays, partial and total reflections, turning rays on forward and reversed branches, head waves, interface waves, Airy caustics, and Fresnel and interface shadows are useful to anticipate and understand numerical problems and results. Finally, a comparison of Green's functions for crustal, mantle, and whole earth models, calculated using the WKBJ and reflectivity algorithms, is included.},

In principle, the problem is straightforward. In practice, many techniques and approximations can be used at each stage and many combinations and variants are possible. In this paper, we discuss a new method of evaluating the inverse transforms. Any method can be used to solve the differential equation and we only discuss a few analytic approximations to illustrate the new method. The inverse transformations are a frequency and wavenumber integral. Essentially four techniques can be used to evaluate these depending on the order of integration and whether the wavenumber integral is distorted from the real axis. Three of these have been widely used, but the technique of evaluating the frequency integral first and keeping the wavenumber real is new. In this paper, we discuss some of the advantages of this combination.},

	Abstract = {The aim of the series of papers to be published under the above title is to follow up and improve Carpenter's (1966) attempt to construct realistic pulse shapes for teleseismic body waves from underground explosions. The present work deals with both explosions and shallow earthquakes and with the radiation of surface waves as well as body waves. The extension of Carpenter's theory to take crustal layering more accurately into account involves the matrix theory first introduced by Thomson (1950) and developed by Haskell. We shall use the notation of Haskell's (1964) paper in the following analysis and the initial theoretical work is concerned with some of the groundwork and one or two results which have not been covered by Haskell in his series of papers (1953, 1962, 1964). A point source can be represented either as a system of forces or as a discontinuity in the displacement or stress or their derivatives across an element of surface. We show here that a general source of either type is equivalent in the generation of elastic radiation to a discontinuity across a horizontal plane in the displacement and the stress acting on the plane. This means that any point source can be put into a form suitable for computations based on the Thomson-Haskell theory. The theory is applied to the construction of theoretical models of earthquake and explosive sources. Some of the more realistic models so far proposed are given in the later section of the paper.},

For the earthquake source models used average Rayleigh wave magnitudes relative to P wave magnitudes are larger than for the explosion source models. This is true even for point sources; increasing the dimensions of the earthquake source only accentuates this difference in the relative excitation of Rayleigh waves. However the relative amplitudes are strongly dependent on the orientation of the observer relative to the fault plane of the earthquake owing to the radiation pattern of the P and Rayleigh waves. Where the observer is at an anti-node of the P radiation the relative amplitudes of the Rayleigh waves are not significantly greater than for explosions. A detailed study of observed P and Rayleigh amplitudes is now needed to see if the same effects of the P radiation pattern can also explain the observed differences in the relative excitation of P and Rayleigh waves by earthquakes and explosions.},

	Abstract = {We determine the 3-D shear wave speed variations in the crust and upper mantle in the southeastern borderland of the Tibetan Plateau, SW China, with data from 25 temporary broad-band stations and one permanent station. Interstation Rayleigh wave (phase velocity) dispersion curves were obtained at periods from 10 to 50 s from empirical Green's function (EGF) derived from (ambient noise) interferometry and from 20 to 150 s from traditional two-station (TS) analysis. Here, we use these measurements to construct phase velocity maps (from 10 to 150 s, using the average interstation dispersion from the EGF and TS methods between 20 and 50 s) and estimate from them (with the Neighbourhood Algorithm) the 3-D wave speed variations and their uncertainty. The crust structure, parametrized in three layers, can be well resolved with a horizontal resolution about of 100 km or less. Because of the possible effect of mechanically weak layers on regional deformation, of particular interest is the existence and geometry of low (shear) velocity layers (LVLs). In some regions prominent LVLs occur in the middle crust, in others they may appear in the lower crust. In some cases the lateral transition of shear wave speed coincides with major fault zones. The spatial variation in strength and depth of crustal LVLs suggests that the 3-D geometry of weak layers is complex and that unhindered crustal flow over large regions may not occur. Consideration of such complexity may be the key to a better understanding of relative block motion and patterns of seismicity.},

	Abstract = {Interstation cross correlations of ambient seismic noise from 1 year of continuous data at periods between 6 and 50 s are used to study the origin of the ambient noise using stations located in Europe, southern Africa, Asia, and three regions within North America. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of Rayleigh waves for positive and negative correlation time lags at periods of 8, 14, 25 and 50 s are used to determine the azimuthal distribution of strong ambient noise sources. Ambient noise in both the primary (10--20 s) and secondary microseism bands (5--10 s) comes dominantly from the directions of relatively nearby coastlines with stronger noise occurring in the Northern Hemisphere in northern winter and in the Southern Hemisphere in southern winter, consistent with the hypothesis that oceanic microseisms are generating this noise. The observed differences in the directivity of noise in the primary and secondary microseism bands are the consequence of propagation and attenuation, rather than the location of generation. At intermediate and long periods ({\textgreater}20 s), there is much less seasonal variation in both signal strength and directivity. We argue that our results are explained most simply by near-coastal sources rather than deep ocean sources at all periods. Although the dominant ambient noise sources are distributed inhomogeneously in azimuth, strong ambient noise emerges from most directions when using recordings that are 1 year in duration. Simulations illustrate that this is what ensures the accuracy of the empirical Green's functions and ambient noise tomography.},

	Abstract = {The Earth's interior can be imaged by analysing the records of propagating seismic waves. However, the global array of permanent seismometers that record seismic energy is confined almost exclusively to land-based sites. This limits the resolution of subsurface images, and results in relatively few local measurements from areas of great geological and tectonic interest (for example, the mid-ocean ridges and the Tibetan plateau)1. Here we use an unconventional form of seismic interferometry2, 3, 4, 5 to turn earthquakes into virtual seismometers located beneath the Earth's surface. Seismic waves generated by one earthquake lead to transient strain in the subsurface at other locations around the globe. This strain can be quantified from seismograms of independent earthquakes that have occurred in those locations. This technique can therefore provide information on the subsurface strain in regions of the globe that lack instrumental networks. Applying our method to earthquakes in Alaska and the southwestern United States, we show that the information that can be obtained from these earthquakes about other such events is consistent with that provided by instrumental seismometers. Our approach may allow real-time, non-invasive, subsurface seismic strain monitoring, particularly in areas remote from instrumental networks.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of Rayleigh wave and Love wave phase velocity tomography in the western United States using ambient seismic noise observed at over 250 broad-band stations from the EarthScope/USArray Transportable Array and regional networks. All available three-component time-series for the 12-month span between 2005 November 1 and 2006 October 31 have been cross-correlated to yield estimated empirical Rayleigh and Love wave Green's functions. The Love wave signals were observed with higher average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than Rayleigh wave signals and hence cannot be fully explained by the scattering of Rayleigh waves. Phase velocity dispersion curves for both Rayleigh and Love waves between 5 and 40 speriod were measured for each interstation path by applying frequency--time analysis. The average uncertainty and systematic bias of the measurements are estimated using a method based on analysing thousands of nearly linearly aligned station-triplets. We find that empirical Green's functions can be estimated accurately from the negative time derivative of the symmetric component ambient noise cross-correlation without explicit knowledge of the source distribution. The average traveltime uncertainty is less than 1 s at periods shorter than 24 s. We present Rayleigh and Love wave phase speed maps at periods of 8, 12, 16,and 20 s. The maps show clear correlations with major geological structures and qualitative agreement with previous results based on Rayleigh wave group speeds.},

	Abstract = {Empirical Green's functions (EGFs) between pairs of seismographs can be estimated from the time derivative of the long-time cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise. These EGFs reveal velocity dispersion at relatively short periods, which can be used to resolve structures in the crust and uppermost mantle better than with traditional surface-wave tomography. We combine Rayleigh-wave dispersion estimates from EGFs and from traditional two-station (TS) analysis into a new approach to surface-wave array tomography with data from dense receiver arrays. We illustrate the methodology with continuous broad-band recordings from a temporary seismographic network on the southeastern part of the Tibetan plateau, in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, SW China. The EGFs are robust under temporal changes in regional seismicity and the use of either ambient noise (approximated by records without signal from events with magnitude mb[{\&}ge;] 5 or 4) or surface wave coda produces similar results. The EGFs do not strongly depend on the presence of large earthquakes, but they are not reciprocal for stations aligned in the N-S direction. This directionality reflects the paucity of seismicity to the north of the array. Using a far-field representation of the surface-wave Green's function and an image transformation technique, we infer from the EGFs the Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion in the period band from 10-30 s. A classical TS approach is used to determine Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion between 20-120 s. Together, they constrain phase velocity variations for T= 10-120 s, which can be used to study the structure from the crust to the upper mantle. Beneath SE Tibet, short and intermediate period (10-80 s) phase velocities are prominently low, suggesting that the crust and upper mantle beneath SE Tibet is characterized by slow shear wave propagation.},

	Abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging field of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency--time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be flexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a significant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

Coherent broadband dispersive wavetrains clearly emerge with group velocities similar to those predicted from the global Rayleigh-wave tomographic maps that have been constrained using ballistic surface waves. Those results show that coherent Rayleigh waves can be extracted from the ambient seismic noise and that their dispersion characteristics can be measured in a broad range of periods.

	Abstract = {We determine the effect of replacing geometrical ray theory in surface wave tomography with scattering theory. We describe a tomographic method based on a simplified version of the scattering sensitivity kernels that emerge from the Born or Rytov approximations in which surface wave travel times are a weighted average of phase or group slowness over the first Fresnel zone of the wave. We apply this ``diffraction tomography'' to Rayleigh and Love wave group velocity measurements to produce group velocity maps from 20 to 150 s period on a 2$\,^{\circ}$ × 2$\,^{\circ}$ grid globally. Using identical data and damping parameters, we also produce maps using ``Gaussian tomography'' which is based on ray theory with intuitive Gaussian smoothing constraints. Significant differences in the amplitude and geometry of the imaged features appear primarily at long periods but exist even in the short-period maps in regions where average path lengths are large. Diffraction tomography, therefore, is significant in most oceanic regions at all periods, but it is also important on continents at long periods at least. On average, diffraction tomography produces larger velocity anomalies in a period-dependent band of spherical harmonic degrees, and diffraction and Gaussian tomography maps decorrelate past a critical spherical harmonic degree that also depends on period. The widths of resolving kernels that emerge from diffraction tomography are systematically larger than those from Gaussian tomography. Finally, mantle features inferred from diffraction tomography tend to have larger amplitudes and extend deeper than those from Gaussian tomography.},

	Abstract = {Using a simple Gaussian beam solution to the one-way scalar wave equation, we derive analytical expressions for the evolution of phase and group delay after a wave passes through a Gaussian-shaped heterogeneity of half width L. As a function of distance $\chi$, there are two clearly separated regimes, depending upon the wavelength $\lambda$ of the wave. In regime I, when $\chi$/L ≪ $\pi$L/$\lambda$, the absolute magnitude of the phase delay decreases approximately linearly with $\chi$, and the anomaly does not widen appreciably except by developing small sidelobes with delays of opposite sign. Tomographie inversions of such delays will be damped but are theoretically well posed. In regime II, when $\chi$/L ≫ $\pi$L/$\lambda$, the absolute delay decreases toward zero as 1/$\chi$, most markedly on the ray itself, and the cross-path shape of the wave front bears little resemblance to the original anomaly. Tomographic inversions of delay times in this regime are ill posed. Group delay times show a similar behavior in the two regimes. Although their rate of decrease with distance is slower in regime I, they develop more disturbing sidelobe behavior off the central ray. The effects of wave front healing for surface waves traveling in two dimensions are less severe than those for body waves in three dimensions; as a result, surface wave inversions will commonly be in regime I. Short-period body wave group delays are also in regime I; nevertheless, the damping of delays in this regime is likely to contribute significantly to the scatter of observed travel time anomalies. Tomographie inversions of long-period body waves, which fall at the limit of regime I, or even in regime II, face perceptible limitations in theoretical resolving power. Finally, we show that there is an asymmetry in the evolution of positive versus negative travel time anomalies.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique in surface wave tomography that takes the finite frequency of surface waves into account using first-order scattering theory in a SNREI Earth. Physically, propagating surface waves with a finite frequency are diffracted by heterogeneity distributed on a sphere and then interfere at the receiver position. Paradoxically, surface waves have the largest sensitivity to velocity anomalies off the path of the geometrical ray. The non-ray geometrical effect is increasingly important for increasing period and distance. Therefore, it is expected that the violation of ray theory in surface wave tomography is most significant for the longest periods. We applied scattering theory to phaseshift measurements of Love waves between periods of 40 and 150 s to obtain global phase velocity maps expanded in spherical harmonics to angular degree and order 40. These models obtained with scattering theory were compared with those constructed with ray theory. We observed that ray theory and scattering theory predict the same structure in the phase velocity maps to degree and order 25-30 for Love waves at 40 s and to degree and order 12-15 for Love waves at 150 s. For reasons of spectral leakage, a smoothness condition was included in the phaseshift inversions to construct the phase velocity maps, so we could not access the small length-scale structure in the obtained Earth models. We carried out a synthetic experiment for phase velocity measurements to investigate the limits of classical ray theory in surface wave tomography. In the synthetic experiment, we computed, using the source-receiver paths of our surface wave data set, the discrepancy between ray theoretical and scattering theoretical phase velocity measurements for an input model with slowness heterogeneity for increasing angular degree. We found that classical ray theory in global surface wave tomography is only applicable for structures with angular degrees smaller than 25 (equivalent to 1600 km) and 15 (equivalent to 2700 km) for Love waves at 40 and 150 s, respectively. The synthetic experiment suggests that the ray theoretical great circle approximation is appropriate to use in present-day global surface wave tomography. On the other hand, in order to obtain reliable models with a higher resolution we must take the non-ray geometrical effect of surface waves into account.},

	Abstract = {Recently a few groups reported existence of Earth's background free oscillations even on seismically quiet days. Observed features suggest that they are persistently excited on or just above the Earth's surface owing most likely to atmospheric and/or oceanic disturbances. To constrain their excitation mechanisms we developed a new method for estimation of spatial distribution of their excitation sources by modeling cross spectra between pairs of stations. The method is to calculate synthetic cross spectra for spatially homogeneous distribution of random sources and invert with them the observed cross spectra to the heterogeneous source distribution. We applied this method to the IRIS records at 54 stations during 1988--2000. The result showed clear temporal variations of spatial patterns. From November to April the spatial distribution shows a degree 1 pattern with the maximum in the North Pacific Ocean. From May to October strong excitation sources are located along the eastern and western Pacific rims through the Indian Ocean. In all the time periods, excitation sources on continents are weaker than in oceanic areas. This temporal variation of the spatial pattern is qualitatively consistent with that reported by Rhie and Romanowicz (2004). However, the excitation sources are not localized in shallow seas, as might be expected from the hypothesis of excitation by ocean infragravity waves, but must be distributed on the whole sea surface.},

	Abstract = {We developed a three-step method for three-dimensional (3-D) S wave velocity tomography by fitting synthetic cross spectra to the observed ones of ambient seismic noise. We applied this method to the recording of Hi-net tiltmeters in Japan at 679 stations from June 2004 to December 2004. First, we calculated normalized cross spectra between radial components and those between transverse components for every pair of stations. The first step is local 1-D S wave velocity inversion for each station assuming small lateral heterogeneity under a 100-km circle of a station. We measured the dispersion curves of fundamental Rayleigh waves, fundamental Love waves, and first overtone of Love waves by fitting the synthetic cross spectra to the observed ones between pairs of stations within the circle. We inverted the measured dispersion curves for obtaining a 1-D S wave velocity model. The second step is the inversion of the observed cross spectra for obtaining path-averaged 1-D S wave velocity structure. The third step is the inversion of the resultant path-averaged structures for obtaining 3-D S wave velocity structure (0.1$\,^{\circ}$ × 0.1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1 km grid from the surface to a depth of 50 km) using ray approximation. The resultant S wave velocity structures show clear low-velocity anomalies along tectonic lines from the surface to a depth of 20 km. In particular, along the Hidaka mountain range, we observed S wave perturbation more extreme than −20{\%}. They also show low-velocity anomalies under volcanoes in Kyusyu and Tohoku. In the southwestern part of Shikoku, our results show a clear low-velocity anomaly corresponding to an accretional belt (Shimanto belt). Below 20 km, we observe a low-velocity anomaly in the center of Japan, which suggests a thick crust.},

Traditional core phase studies rely on well-defined earthquake signals, which are spatially and temporally limited. We show that, by stacking ambient-noise cross-correlations between USArray seismometers, body wave phases reflected off the outer core (ScS), and twice refracted through the inner core (PKIKP2) can be clearly extracted. Temporal correlation between the amplitude of these core phases and global seismicity suggests that the signals originate from distant earthquakes and emerge due to array interferometry. Similar results from a seismic array in New Zealand demonstrate that our approach is applicable in other regions and with fewer station pairs. Extraction of core phases by interferometry can significantly improve the spatial sampling of the deep Earth because the technique can be applied anywhere broadband seismic arrays exist.},

The results show a prominent difference of the frequency dependence of attenuation between the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere: while attenuation is frequency dependent in the western hemisphere, not so in the eastern hemisphere. Moreover, in the western hemisphere, a stronger frequency dependence of the attenuation is observed beneath Africa compared to beneath North America. This intricate quasi-hemispherical property of the frequency dependence of the inner core attenuation, together with the quasi-hemispherical variability of seismic velocity and attenuation strength at around 1 Hz that we reported earlier, can be consistently understood in terms of the relative location of the seismic observation frequency band and the absorption band peaks that are different for regions. The variability of the absorption band peak may reflect the variability of the iron grain size of the inner core: the grain size is larger in the eastern hemisphere than the western hemisphere, and in the western hemisphere beneath North America, it gradually increases with depth. However, caution should be taken in this inference as the physical mechanism of attenuation in the inner core is still poorly constrained both theoretically and observationally.},

	Abstract = {The development of global surface wave tomography using earthquakes has been crucial to exploration of the dynamic status of Earth's deep. It is naturally believed that only large earthquakes can generate long-period seismic waves that penetrate deep enough into Earth for such exploration. The discovery of seismic hum, Earth's background free oscillations, which are randomly generated by oceanic and/or atmospheric disturbances, now provides an alternative approach. We present results of global upper-mantle seismic tomography using seismic hum and without referring to earthquakes. At periods of 100 to 400 seconds, the phase-velocity anomalies of Rayleigh waves are measured by modeling the observed cross-correlation functions between every pair of stations from among 54 globally distributed seismic stations. The anomalies are then inverted to obtain the three-dimensional S-wave velocity structure in the upper mantle. Our technique provides a new means for exploring the three-dimensional structure of the interior of terrestrial planets with an atmosphere and/or oceans, particularly Mars.},

	Abstract = {We estimated both P (Vp) and S wave velocity (Vs) structures beneath northeastern Japan by applying a tomographic method to 169,712 P and 103,993 S wave arrival time data from 4338 local events. The average value of Vp/Vs ratio is ∼1.69 in the upper crust, ∼1.75 in the lower crust, and ∼1.77 in the uppermost mantle. These differences in Vp/Vs ratio may mainly reflect the lithological variations with depth. Low-Vp, low-Vs, and high Vp/Vs zones are extensively distributed along the volcanic front in the uppermost mantle and are downward to the back arc side in the mantle wedge. Here the low-Vp, low-Vs, and high Vp/Vs values are interpreted because of partial melting materials, which imply the presence of a vast amount of melt in the uppermost mantle. In the lower crust, low-Vp, low-Vs, and high Vp/Vs zones are not continuously visible along the volcanic front but are confined to individual volcanic areas, which suggests that melting of lower crustal materials occurs just beneath each active volcano. In contrast, the upper crust beneath active volcanoes exhibits low Vp, low Vs, and low Vp/Vs. These results suggest that the partial melting zones under northeastern Japan spread out from the uppermost mantle along the volcanic front up to the midcrust right beneath active volcanoes. The low-Vp, low-Vs, and low Vp/Vs features in the upper crust suggest the existence of H2O (rather than melt) right beneath active volcanoes.},

An efficient three dimensional ray tracing algorithm which iteratively uses the pseudobending technique and Snell's law is developed. The large and sparse system of observation equations is solved by using the LSQR algorithm. This method is applied to 18,679 arrival times from 470 shallow and intermediate-depth earthquakes in order to study P and S wave tomographic images beneath northeastern Japan. In addition to first P and S wave arrivals, clear later arrivals of SP waves converted at the Moho and PS and SP waves converted at the upper boundary of the subducted Pacific plate (UBPP) are also used in the inversion. The UBPP, Conrad and Moho are taken as three SVDs, and their depth distributions obtained by previous studies are used. High-resolution P and S wave tomographic images down to a depth of 200 km have been determined. Large velocity variations amounting to 6{\%} for P wave and 10{\%} for S wave are revealed in the crust and upper mantle. In the crust low-velocity (low-V) zones exist beneath active volcanoes. In the upper mantle the low-V zones dip toward the west from the volcanic front. A high-velocity (high- V) zone corresponding to the subducted Pacific plate is clearly delineated. Most earthquakes in the lower plane of the double-planed deep seismic zone are found to occur in relatively high-V areas. The obtained tomographic images are also found to explain other seismological observations well.},

	Abstract = {Travel-time tomography beneath the northeastern Japan arc reveals that an inclined low-velocity zone exists in the mantle wedge, sub-parallel to the down-dip direction of the slab. This zone, distributed continuously along the arc as a single inclined sheet, has been considered as the main source of arc magma. A quantitative interpretation of both P- and S-wave velocity structures precisely determined from the recent travel-time tomography is done in terms of thermal heterogeneity and fluid content. The combined analysis of both P- and S-wave velocity structures makes it possible to independently derive the information on the shape and volume fraction of the fluid-filled pores. The reference P- and S-wave velocities representing the host rock velocities at reference temperature T0 are estimated from the tomographic data, while an alternative method based on high-temperature and high-pressure elasticity of upper mantle minerals is used to confirm the validity of the present method. The calculated velocity anomalies are corrected for the thermal effect using the three-dimensional thermal structure estimated from the P-wave attenuation data, showing that the observed low-velocity anomalies cannot be explained by the thermal effect alone. The remaining velocity anomalies are explained by the existence of melt-filled pores and effective aspect ratio and volume fraction of the pores are determined. The results show a systematic change in melt-filled pore shapes with depth, suggesting the existence of 3--6 vol.{\%} melts as grain boundary tubules at a depth of 90 km, 0.04--0.05 vol.{\%} melts as thin cracks or dikes with aspect ratio of ∼0.001 at a depth of 65 km, and 1--2 vol.{\%} melts as cracks or dikes with aspect ratio of 0.02--0.04 at a depth of 40 km.},

	Abstract = {Shear-wave polarization anisotropy in the central part of northeastern (NE) Japan was investigated. We analyzed S phases of 293 intermediate-depth earthquakes recorded at 77 stations and obtained 1286 splitting parameters. The obtained results show the systematic variation in splitting parameters across the arc. The leading shear-wave polarization directions (fast direction) obtained at stations in the western side of the study area are oriented nearly E--W, which is sub-parallel to the direction of relative plate motion between the Pacific plate and the North American/Okhotsk plate. In contrast, fast directions obtained at stations in the eastern side of the study area are oriented approximately N--S. Stations in the western side have a larger average delay time compared to those in the eastern side. These variations suggest that the nature of anisotropy is quite different between the eastern and the western sides. Both experimental studies on the deformation of olivine and numerical simulations of plate-driven flow predict that the lattice-preferred orientation of olivine causes the fast direction sub-parallel to the flow direction for the conditions in the mantle wedge of NE Japan. We thus infer that the lattice-preferred orientation of olivine generated by flow-induced strain is the most likely candidate for anisotropy that produces splitting with E--W fast direction. Three possible causes of anisotropy in the eastern side are considered: deformation of water-rich olivine in the mantle wedge, trench-parallel flow in the mantle wedge due to along-strike dip variations in the slab and anisotropy in the crust and the slab. We could not, however, determine which causes are dominant. Further systematic study is required to reveal the cause of anisotropy in the eastern side.},

Our data indicate that water is released from the hydrated oceanic crust at shallow depths ({\textless} approximately 100 kilometers) and then forms a channel of hydrated mantle material on top of the subducting plate that is the pathway for water into the deep mantle. Our result provides direct evidence that shows how water is transported from the ocean to the deep mantle in a cold subduction zone environment.},

@article{Tao2014,
	Abstract = {We analyzed tens of thousands of receiver-function data recorded by 185 broadband seismic stations to study the crustal structure beneath the northeast China. Moho depth and average crustal Vp/Vs ratio were measured at each station using the H--$\kappa$ grid searching technique. For stations located above unconsolidated sediments, we applied the H--$\beta$ method to remove strong shallow reverberations and generate subsurface receiver functions that allow for effective H--$\kappa$ analysis. The measurements show that the Songliao basin has a relatively thin crust (∼31 km), and the Moho depth increases significantly from southeast (∼27 km) to northwest (∼35 km). The northwestward tilting of the Songliao basin may suggest that it was initiated by lithospheric flexure due to the load of the Great Xing'an range in the Jurassic before the large-scale extension in the Cretaceous. Moho depth varies from 26.7 km to 42.3 km across the study area, with the shallowest and deepest Moho being located at the eastern flank of the Songliao basin and the Great Xing'an range, respectively. The Moho depth correlates well with the surface topography in the western part, but not the central and eastern parts of the study area. The residual topography computed based on the Airy's isostasy model indicates that the high topography at the eastern flank of the Songliao basin, the Changbaishan volcanic center, and the southern end of the Great Xing'an range is likely dynamically supported by the upper mantle.},

@article{Tang2014,
	Abstract = {Volcanism that occurs far from plate margins is difficult to explain with the current paradigm of plate tectonics. The Changbaishan volcanic complex, located on the border between China and North Korea, lies approximately 1,300 km away from the Japan Trench subduction zone and is unlikely to result from a mantle plume rising from a thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle. Here we use seismic images and three-dimensional waveform modelling results obtained from the NECESSArray experiment to identify a slow, continuous seismic anomaly in the mantle beneath Changbaishan. The anomaly extends from just below 660 km depth to the surface beneath Changbaishan and occurs within a gap in the stagnant subducted Pacific Plate. We propose that the anomaly represents hot and buoyant sub-lithospheric mantle that has been entrained beneath the sinking lithosphere of the Pacific Plate and is now escaping through a gap in the subducting slab. We suggest that this subduction-induced upwelling process produces decompression melting that feeds the Changbaishan volcanoes. Subduction-induced upwelling may also explain back-arc volcanism observed at other subduction zones.},

	Abstract = {Short-period array seismograms of deep events that occurred in the Indonesia, Japan and Izu-Bonin arcs are stacked and beam-formed to identify the near-source S-P converted waves that result from the mantle transition discontinuities. Most of the resulting images reveal the existence of a mid-mantle seismic discontinuity (``920 km discontinuity'') in these regions. Of the 15 events analyzed, three that occurred at the western end of the Indonesia arc show clear S-P arrivals observable even in individual seismograms. The mid-mantle discontinuity is characterized by large depth variation (900 ∼ 1080 km) and velocity contrast variation in different subduction zones. Especially, the depth variation of the mid-mantle discontinuity beneath the Indonesia arc, where the discontinuity deepens from 940 km at the eastern end to 1080 km at the western end, appears to be well correlated with the location of the high-velocity anomalies in recent tomographic models. However, the mid-mantle discontinuity cannot be simply coincided with the bottom of the high-velocity anomalies, because a velocity increase at the discontinuity is observed from the waveform analysis.},

@article{Song1995a,
	Abstract = {Present Earth core models derived from the retrieval of global Earth structure are based on absolute travel times, mostly from the International Seismological Centre (ISC), and/or free-oscillation eigenfrequencies. Many core phase data are left out of these constructions, e.g., PKP differential travel times, amplitude ratios, and waveforms. This study is an attempt to utilize this additional information to construct a model of core P wave velocity which is consistent with the different types of core phase data available. In conjunction with our waveform modeling we used 150 differential time measurements and 87 amplitude ratio measurements, which were the highest-quality observations chosen from a large population of Global Digital Seismograph Network (GDSN) records. As a result of fitting these various data sets, a one-dimensional P wave velocity model of the core, PREM2, is proposed. This model, modified from the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981), shows a better fit to the combined data set than any of the existing core models. Major features of the model include a sharp velocity discontinuity at the inner core boundary (ICB), with a large jump (0.78 km/s), and a low velocity gradient at the base of the fluid core. The velocity is nearly constant over the lower 100 km of the outer core. The model features a depth-dependent Q$\alpha$ structure in the inner core such that a constant t* for the inner core fits the amplitude ratios and waveforms of short-period waves moderately well. This means the top of the inner core is more attenuating than the deeper part of the inner core. In addition, the P velocity in the lowermost mantle is reduced from that of PREM as a baseline adjustment for the observed separations of the DF and AB branches of PKP at large distances.},

@article{Tkalcic2002,
	Abstract = {The effects of complex structure in the deep mantle and D'' on PKP differential traveltimes should be estimated accurately in order to reach reliable conclusions concerning the physical and chemical properties of the Earth's inner and outer core. In particular, it is important to assess how much of the data can be explained by mantle structure alone. For this purpose, we have assembled global data sets of high-quality PKP(AB-DF), PKP(BC-DF) and PcP-P differential traveltimes measured on mostly broad-band records. The PKP(AB-DF) data were inverted alone or jointly with PcP-P data, to retrieve P-velocity maps of the lowermost 300 km of the mantle. Corrections for mantle structure above D'' were performed prior to inversion using recent tomographic models and the fit to the PKP(BC-DF) data set was used to constrain damping in the inversions. We compare models obtained with and without polar PKP paths and find that their inclusion or exclusion does not significantly affect the resulting D'' model except under North America, where coverage is poor without polar paths. Our preferred model, obtained using PKP(AB-DF) and PcP-P data combined, explains over 80 per cent of the variance in PKP(AB-DF), almost 60 per cent of the variance in PcP-P and 27 per cent of the variance in PKP(BC-DF)--a significant portion considering that the PKP(BC-DF) data set was not used in the inversion. Our models are characterized by prominent fast features under mid-America and east Asia, a fast belt across the Pacific, a slow region under the southwestern Pacific and southern Africa, as well as sharp transitions from fast to slow, for instance under Alaska and the South Atlantic. The anomalous South Sandwich to Alaska data cannot fully be explained by D'' structure alone, unless very short-wavelength lateral variations are introduced. Models that allow for a modest level of constant transverse anisotropy in the inner core, compatible with normal mode splitting data, perform somewhat better, but still fail to explain the result of 2 s in PKP(BC-DF) residuals, on these anomalous paths.},

	Abstract = {Long-period PKP amplitudes from 16 earthquakes in the distance range 110-- 170$\,^{\circ}$ are compared with theoretical amplitudes which are derived from synthetic seismograms calculated for 56 systematic modifications of Earth model 1066B in the inner core. A suitable normalization procedure allows for the common representation of all observed amplitudes as a function of epicentral distance. Using the theoretical amplitude distributions it can be shown that the parameters of a regression line through the logarithmic and normalized amplitudes between 110 and 134$\,^{\circ}$ are related to the velocity and density jump at the inner-core boundary (ICB). The analysis shows that the dominant influence on the PKP amplitudes is the P-velocity jump which can be restricted to 0.64 $\pm$ 0.05 km s−1. There exists a trade-off between the S-velocity jump and the density jump. Restricting the latter to the reasonable range 0--1.2 g cm−3 the S-velocity jump at the ICB can be inferred to be 2.5--3.0 km s−1. A rather strong S-velocity gradient below the ICB follows from the condition that the S-wave travel-time through the inner core agrees with that implied by free oscillation observations. This leads to central S-velocities between 3.81 and 4.15 km s−1, assuming a parabolic velocity law.},

	Abstract = {The GRF (Gr{\"{a}}fenberg) seismic array in Germany is located at epicentral distances immediately before the PKP caustic B generated by underground nuclear explosions on the French atolls Mururoa and Fangataufa in the South Pacific. I use the large-amplitude PKP waveforms to improve the locations of underground explosions near these French atolls. The core phases are investigated using theoretical seismograms calculated with an extended reflectivity method. Near the caustic range, the waveforms are strongly distance dependent due to a rapid decrease in PKPdiff amplitudes before the caustic B. On the basis of their different slownesses, beam-forming and velocity-spectral (vespagram) analyses are used to identify PKPdiff, PKIKP, and PKiKP, which arrive within a few seconds of each other. Amplitudes and travel times of the weak secondary arrivals PKIKP and PKiKP are measured from the corresponding beams using a matched-filter technique. Theoretical seismograms show a change in the amplitude ratio PKIKP/PKPdiff by a factor of 2 for explosions separated by 30 km. This distance-dependent amplitude ratio is tested as a discriminant for closely spaced explosions using 31 Mururoa and five Fangataufa events. On average, the observed amplitude ratios agree with the theoretically expected amplitude-ratio behavior with distance. A combined analysis of travel time and amplitude data indicates that the investigated Mururoa explosions were detonated beneath a relatively large area of the atoll (ca. 80{\%}), whereas on Fangataufa, explosion epicenters were concentrated within a small portion of the island. This finding contrasts the ISC/PDE epicenter determinations, which, due to insufficient station coverage, locate the majority of the explosions outside of the rim of the atolls.},

	Abstract = {The receiver function method (RFM) is a commonly used technique to study the crustal and upper mantle velocity structure. Early receiver function (RF) investigations were performed mostly at individual permanent stations. They were focused on crustal structures, and later on upper mantle velocity discontinuities (410 km and 660 km discontinuities). Only recently has research been directed towards the study of the lateral (2- and 3-D) variability of major velocity boundaries in the crust and upper mantle by receiver function arrays using temporary and permanent, three-component, short-period and broad-band seismic stations. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, receiver functions are calculated for individual earthquakes and are then binned, moveout corrected and stacked. We show that this processing sequence is similar to that applied routinely in exploration seismology. Therefore, existing tools from the nearvertical data processing can be adopted for receiver functions: velocity analysis tools, solutions for static and residual static problems, coherence enhancement of seismic phases, migration, etc. The high spatial density of seismic stations of recent and future receiver function experiments provides the opportunity (and obligation) to use the more sophisticated migration methods (full wavefield migration) commonly and successfully used in exploration seismics. paraSynthetics calculated by the finite difference method for simple 2-D crustal models are employed here to test our processing approach and to show the potentials and limitations of stacking and migrating RF data. We show that binning, normal moveout (NMO) corrections, stacking and post-stack migration of the synthetic data can reconstruct the models reliably with a high spatial resolution.},

	Abstract = {The number of broadband three-component seismic stations in southern California has more than tripled recently. In this study we use the teleseismic receiver function technique to determine the crustal thicknesses and Vp/Vs ratios for these stations and map out the lateral variation of Moho depth under southern California. It is shown that a receiver function can provide a very good ``point'' measurement of crustal thickness under a broadband station and is not sensitive to crustal P velocity. However, the crustal thickness estimated only from the delay time of the Moho P-to-S converted phase trades off strongly with the crustal Vp/Vs ratio. The ambiguity can be reduced significantly by incorporating the later multiple converted phases, namely, the PpPs and PpSs+PsPs. We propose a stacking algorithm which sums the amplitudes of receiver function at the predicted arrival times of these phases by different crustal thicknesses H and Vp/Vs ratios. This transforms the time domain receiver functions directly into the H-Vp/Vs domain without need to identify these phases and to pick their arrival times. The best estimations of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio are found when the three phases are stacked coherently. By stacking receiver functions from different distances and directions, effects of lateral structural variation are suppressed, and an average crustal model is obtained. Applying this technique to 84 digital broadband stations in southern California reveals that the Moho depth is 29 km on average and varies from 21 to 37 km. Deeper Mohos are found under the eastern Transverse Range, the Peninsular Range, and the Sierra Nevada Range. The central Transverse Range, however, does not have a crustal root. Thin crusts exist in the Inner California Borderland (21--22 km) and the Salton Trough (22 km). The Moho is relatively flat at the average depth in the western and central Mojave Desert and becomes shallower to the east under the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ). Southern California crust has an average Vp/Vs ratio of 1.78, with higher ratios of 1.8 to 1.85 in the mountain ranges with Mesozoic basement and lower ratios in the Mojave Block except for the ECSZ, where the ratio increases.},

	Abstract = {Teleseismic long-period P waves recorded at the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network station LON (Longmire, Washington) are shown to exhibit strong anomalous particle motion not attributable to instrument miscalibration or malfunction. In particular, a large and azimuthally smoothly varying tangential component is observed after vector rotation of horizontal P waves into the ray direction and after application of a deconvolution technique which equalizes effective source time functions and removes the instrument response. These tangential waves attain amplitudes comparable to the radial component and demonstrate wave form antisymmetry about a NNE azimuth. A model which contains a single high-contrast interface dipping toward the NNE at a depth of 15--20 km can explain most of the characteristics of the long-period P wave data, provided dips are greater than about 10$\,^{\circ}$ and only the interference of P and Ps generated at the interface is considered. The model breaks down for later arrivals which are presumably multiples or scattered waves. Examination of long-period S waves from several deep teleseisms shows a prominent Sp arrival 18 s before S. The timing of this phase conversion suggests an interface at about 145-km depth, and its sense of polarity suggests that the velocity contrast is from higher to lower velocities as depth decreases. This interface may correspond to the bottom of the upper mantle low-velocity zone in the area.},

Thus, our expectations of its accuracy, robustness, and reliability are high. Amazingly, seismic migration usually delivers. The past few decades have seen migration move from its heuristic roots to mathematically sound techniques that, using relatively few assumptions, render accurate pictures of the interior of the earth. Interestingly, the earth and the subjects we want to image inside it are varied enough that, so far, no single migration technique has dominated practical application. All techniques continually improve and borrow from each other, so one technique may never dominate. Despite the progress in structural imaging, we have not reached the point where seismic images provide quantitatively accurate descriptions of rocks and fluids. Nor have we attained the goal of using migration as part of ...},

Measures are considered from three points of view: the domain in which they are applied, the philosophy of their design, and the manner in which they are used.Crosscorrelation, the most familiar of the likeness criteria, is examined in detail. Differences of design philosophy are noted as expressing themselves by a change in the normalization. Semblance is shown to be related to an energy-normalized crosscorrelation and to share certain features of the summation method or stack which has been used recently as a coherence measure.Several coherence measures, including semblance, are considered in a problem environment--the determination of stacking velocities from multiple ground coverage seismic data. A noise-free synthetic example is studied in order to compare discrimination thresholds of the various methods. Semblance, when properly interpreted, proves to have the greatest power of discrimination among the candidates examined for the particular application.},

	Abstract = {Seismic coda waves have complex waveforms and are considered to be caused by 3-dimensional structural heterogeneities. We carried out 3-component small-aperture array observations of seismic coda waves from natural earthquakes in Tsukuba, central Japan, to decompose complex coda waveforms and to clarify the nature of crustal heterogeneity. Epicentral distances in the present study are less than 200 km. The observational results are summarized as follows: 1) The remarkable feature of the coda from natural earthquakes is the difference between the P-coda and the S-coda especially in the vertical component. The P-coda consists mainly of coherent P-wave phases which have almost the same slowness vector as the initial P-wave motion, whereas the S-coda is decomposed into incoherent phases with random propagation directions. 2) Coherency of waveforms among the array sensors of the vertical component rapidly becomes low from the high value of coherency of the direct S-wave. 3) In the two horizontal components, radial and transverse ones, both the P- and S-coda are decomposed into incoherent random phases. 4) Coherency in the early S-coda of the horizontal components gradually becomes low compared to the vertical component. These features indicate that S to P converted waves at horizontal boundaries of the structure are dominant in the P-coda of the vertical component, while the P-coda of the horizontal components and the S-coda consist of scattered waves from the lateral heterogeneity. This interpretation leads to a model of crustal heterogeneity in which the degree of the lateral heterogeneity is smaller than the degree of vertical heterogeneity of layered structures.},

	Abstract = {Lower mantle structure beneath central Eurasia is examined using a recently developed technique for migrating parametric representations of shear waves from teleseismic events. The migration method of Lay and Young [Lay, T., Young, C.J., 1996. Imaging scattering structures in the lower mantle by migration of long period shear waves. J. Geophys. Res., 101: 20 023--20 040.] assumes isotropic scattering from discrete heterogeneities to account for S wave coda arrivals, and provides resolution at scale lengths of about 500 km. The migration is applied to 15 s period shear wave data from 21 western Pacific earthquakes recorded in Europe and the Middle East that exhibit extra arrivals between S and ScS on the transverse components. Migrations are performed using PREM as well as model SGLE [Gaherty, J.B., Lay, T., 1992. Investigation of laterally heterogeneous shear velocity structure in D″ beneath Eurasia. J. Geophys. Res., 97: 417--435.], which has a discontinuity at 2605 km, 286 km above the core--mantle boundary. The migration images for the most coherent coda arrival (Scd) resemble those expected for a lower mantle discontinuity model and simulations are performed for models with discontinuities at various depths. Quantitative correlation of the images for the data and synthetic migrations show the optimal average depth of the discontinuity to be 2605 km. Migrations of subsets of the data suggest that the discontinuity depth varies from 2605 km in the northern end of the study area to 2620 km in the southern end. An additional intermediate arrival (Scd2) is observed in a limited portion of the dataset, and migrations indicate this phase is generated by localized discrete scatterers located at depths of 2750 to 2770 km under north--central Eurasia. These results are generally consistent with previous forward modeling studies, but the migration approach allows lateral variations to be modeled more systematically. The heterogeneous structure near the base of the mantle appears to be a manifestation of a complex boundary layer.},

@article{Bostock1999,
	Abstract = {The retrieval of near-receiver mantle structure from scattered waves associated with teleseismic P and S and recorded on three-component, linear seismic arrays is considered in the context of inverse scattering theory. A Ray + Born formulation is proposed which admits linearization of the forward problem and economy in the computation of the elastic wave Green's function. The high-frequency approximation further simplifies the problem by enabling (1) the use of an earth-flattened, 1-D reference model, (2) a reduction in computations to 2-D through the assumption of 2.5-D experimental geometry, and (3) band-diagonalization of the Hessian matrix in the inverse formulation. The final expressions are in a form reminiscent of the classical diffraction stack of seismic migration. Implementation of this procedure demands an accurate estimate of the scattered wave contribution to the impulse response, and thus requires the removal of both the reference wavefield and the source time signature from the raw record sections. An approximate separation of direct and scattered waves is achieved through application of the inverse free-surface transfer operator to individual station records and a Karhunen-Loeve transform to the resulting record sections. This procedure takes the full displacement field to a wave vector space wherein the first principal component of the incident wave-type section is identified with the direct wave and is used as an estimate of the source time function. The scattered displacement field is reconstituted from the remaining principal components using the forward free-surface transfer operator, and may be reduced to a scattering impulse response upon deconvolution of the source estimate. An example employing pseudo-spectral synthetic seismograms demonstrates an application of the methodology.},

	Abstract = {We investigate arrivals of seismic phases reflected from the core--mantle boundary (PcP waves) and those reflected from the inner-core boundary (PKiKP waves) at subcritical angles, with the goal of measuring their amplitude ratios. This adds invaluable data points required to study the density jump across the inner-core boundary (ICB). One nuclear explosion and one earthquake, both with favourable focal mechanisms are identified as sources that produce an excellent and abundant record of arrivals of both PcP and PKiKP waves at multiple stations. There is only a limited number of detections of both types of waves on the same seismogram, while more frequently, either one or another of the two phases is detected. Thus, for those cases where at least one phase is above a detectable level, we observe a highly significant negative correlation (anti-correlation) of phase appearances on seismograms, where PcP and PKiKP phase-detections are treated as dichotomous, categorical random variables that can take values detected or undetected. The fact that similar anti-correlation in detection is observed for both explosive and tectonic sources makes less likely the possibility that source effects or a specific near source structure is responsible for this phenomenon. Although laterally varying structure near the core--mantle boundary (CMB) can account for the magnitude of observed fluctuations in the amplitude ratio of PKiKP to PcP, the Fresnel volumes surrounding their ray paths are well separated at the CMB at the frequencies of interest. This separation excludes the possibility that complex structure at or near the CMB is the dominant effect responsible for the observed anti-correlation. We demonstrate that the interaction of the wavefield with near-receiver heterogeneities is an important additional source of amplitude fluctuations across arrays of stations, and the likely cause of the anti-correlation between PKiKP and PcP detections and their spatial coherences at regional arrays. The combined effects of heterogeneities near the surface and the CMB have a profound impact on the estimates of the PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios and the subsequent estimates of the density jump at the ICB.},

	Abstract = {Short-period vertical seismograms from ten earthquakes and one nuclear explosion in the distance range of 140--170 degrees are examined for a study of the anelastic properties of the inner core. The depth of the earthquake foci varies between 116 and 625 km. The phases of interest are PKP(BC branch) and PKIKP with bottoming depths in the upper few hundred kilometers of the inner core. The data consist of high-quality digital data at sampling rates 2040 samples per second selected after an extensive search of the 1985--1986 GDSN event tapes for short-period P waves with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The results are based primarily upon observations between distances of 147$\,^{\circ}$ and 154$\,^{\circ}$. Useful information regarding the attenuation characteristics of the region below the inner core boundary (ICB) can be obtained from the observed relative amplitude and frequency content of the PKIKP and PKP(BC) phases. We have used Fourier spectral ratios of PKIKP-PKP(BC) for the estimation of the attenuation along the inner core segment of the ray path. Because of the limited frequency band of the data, it is difficult to resolve any frequency dependence for Q. Within the depth range of 150--300 km below the inner core boundary, the data yield a maximum likelihood estimate of 175 for the mean estimate of Q$\alpha$, with no clear indication of depth dependence.},

	Abstract = {To constrain the elastic structure of the Earth's inner core, we have picked the differential times of 879 core-penetrating body waves from vertical-component, short-period seismograms recorded by global and regional seismic networks. Using a cross-correlation technique, we measure the difference in arrival times of P′BC-P′DF and P′AB-P′DF where the P′DF (PKIKP) phase penetrates the inner core, while both the P′BC (PKP-BC) and P′AB (PKP-AB) phases bottom in the outer core. P′BC-P′DF times for paths that are nearly parallel to the Earth's spin axis are consistently 2--4 s larger than predicted using the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), while rays in other directions have a mean and standard deviation of 0.2 $\pm$ 0.4 s. P′AB-P′DF times, which correspond to P′DF rays turning deeper in the inner core, are 3--6 s for rays nearly parallel to the spin axis and 0.3 $\pm$ 0.9 s for rays not near the spin axis. These observations lead to the robust conclusion that the inner core is strongly anisotropic. The level of anisotropy in our model is about 3{\%} at a radius of 1000 km (depth of 200 km) and increases to about 4{\%} at a radius of about 700 km. Below this radius, our resolution is poor, but the anisotropy appears to weaken. Resolution is also weak in the outer 200 km of the inner core, but the anisotropy appears to diminish in this region as well. A simple model of hexagonally symmetric anisotropy aligned with the spin axis explains 74{\%} of the variance. The symmetry direction which fits the data the best and explains 79{\%} of the variance is at 80$\,^{\circ}$N, 120$\,^{\circ}$E. The locus of directions which explain 70--79{\%} of the variance includes only 4{\%} of the possible range of directions, and includes the spin axis direction. The observed anisotropy is most likely due to preferred alignment of elastically anisotropic crystals. We propose several new alignment mechanisms and all viable mechanisms seem to be associated with a strong toroidal magnetic field. An outstanding problem that requires further investigation is that first-principles calculations of seismic anisotropy of hexagonal close packed (hcp) iron suggest that anisotropy of order 3{\%} is predicted. Thus, 100{\%} alignment could go a long way towards explaining our observations, but seems highly unlikely.},

	Abstract = {We present a significant addition to the data set of traveltimes of seismic PKP waves that sample the Earth's lowermost mantle and core along the Earth's rotation axis. Recorded at permanent Global Seismic Network (GSN) and temporary SSCUA deployment broad-band seismographic stations in Antarctica, the new data improve the previously poor and biased coverage that underlies the seismic constraints on recent models of inner core structure and anisotropy. On the one hand, new differential PKP traveltime measurements improve the sampling of predominantly the eastern inner core hemisphere. PKPab-df and PKPbc-df differential traveltime residuals, with respect to the spherically symmetric model ak135, are consistently smaller than two seconds along the north-south paths sampled. Axially symmetric models of inner core seismic anisotropy with fast axis parallel to the Earth's rotation axis require a weak anisotropy of (0.7 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.1) per cent to be consistent with our PKPbc-df observations. PKPbc-df residuals from the quasi-eastern hemisphere indicate (0.4 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.1) per cent anisotropy. If only PKPbc-df observations from the top 200 km of this hemisphere are considered, this is reduced to (0.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.2) per cent, consistent with an isotropic layer. On the other hand, new absolute PKP traveltime measurements add to the sampling of both hemispheres of the inner core, but it is difficult to use them with more confidence to assess structure of the core since they are affected by crustal and mantle structure and source uncertainties. The newly collected data set also increases constraints on D" structure beneath the South Pole. In contrast to previous inferences based on data from northern stations, we find no evidence of a velocity heterogeneity in the outer core near the inner core boundary associated with the cylinder tangent to the inner core in the southern hemisphere.},

	Abstract = {The spectral splitting of the Earth's free oscillation eigenfrequencies$\backslash$ndeparts from that predicted on the basis of ellipticity and rotation$\backslash$nbecause of lateral heterogeneity in the structure of the Earth's$\backslash$nmantle and core and because of deviations from hydrostatic ellipticity$\backslash$nof the major internal discontinuities. For an isolated multiplet$\backslash$nof angular degree l, singlet eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions$\backslash$nare fully determined by the coefficients cst of the splitting function$\backslash$n(s = 0,2,4,{\ldots}, 2l, −s ≤ t ≤ s). These coefficients constitute linear$\backslash$ncontraints on the Earth's heterogeneous structure of even spherical$\backslash$nharmonic degree s and order t; they are analogous, in this and other$\backslash$nrespects, to the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the$\backslash$nphase velocity distribution of a surface wave of given frequency.$\backslash$nFor an earthquake having known source parameters, knowledge of the$\backslash$nsplitting coefficients is also sufficient to predict, through a nonlinear$\backslash$nrelationship, the spectra of the multiplet at all stations. This$\backslash$npaper addresses the nonlinear inverse problem of estimating the splitting$\backslash$ncoefficients, cst , using, as data, observed spectra of the multiplet$\backslash$nfor an array of sources and receivers. The problem is solved by an$\backslash$niterative, least squares procedure in which the individual data are$\backslash$nthe complex spectral values obtained by Fourier transformation of$\backslash$nwindowed, long-period accelerograms from the International Deployment$\backslash$nof Accelerometers (IDA) network. Using recordings of large events$\backslash$nsince 1977, the data set consists of approximately 1000 narrow spectral$\backslash$nwindows, relating to 27 different modes, each spectral window containing$\backslash$none or two multiplets. The splitting function possesses a real part,$\backslash$nwhich is related to heterogeneity in density and elastic properties,$\backslash$nand an imaginary part corresponding to asphericity of anelastic parameters.$\backslash$nInversion is limited to the real and imaginary parts of the splitting$\backslash$nfunction for degree s = 0 and to the real part only for degrees s$\backslash$n= 2, 4. The complex c 00 term provides a very accurate determination$\backslash$nof the degenerate eigenfrequency and attenuation of the multiplet,$\backslash$nwhich constitute additional constraints on the spherically averaged$\backslash$nEarth. We find that splitting is systematically larger than that$\backslash$npredicted due to rotation and ellipticity. This phenomenon is particularly$\backslash$nevident for the PKIKP-equivalent modes (e.g., 13 S 2, 11 S 4) and$\backslash$nfor some very long period modes (3 S 2, 2 S 3) with significant sensitivity$\backslash$nin the inner core; it is also present, however, for modes sensitive$\backslash$nprimarily to mantle structure. Comparison between splitting functions$\backslash$nand the kernels characterizing their sensitivity with depth enables$\backslash$nus to identify large-scale patterns of heterogeneity in the Earth's$\backslash$nmantle and core. Forward modeling using existing heterogeneous mantle$\backslash$nmodels produces splitting functions in substantial agreement with$\backslash$nthose obtained from the modal observations if it is assumed that$\backslash$nvp and vs heterogeneity are proportional; it is necessary, however,$\backslash$nthat d In vs /d In vp has a value in the range 2 to 2.5 in the lower$\backslash$nmantle, a value much larger than is often supposed and roughly corresponding$\backslash$nto the case that lateral variations in shear modulus dominate those$\backslash$nin bulk modulus. Because the modal data are principally sensitive$\backslash$nto vS and the prior models of the lower mantle are based on short-period$\backslash$nP residuals, a possible explanation is that the P heterogeneity at$\backslash$nmodal periods is greater than that inferred at ∼1s period. However,$\backslash$nsome mantle modes have nonnegligible sensitivity to vp and provide$\backslash$nevidence that the level of vp heterogeneity is the same at modal$\backslash$nperiods as it is at 1s, thus supporting, using an entirely different$\backslash$nkind of data, both the size and the pattern of lower mantle vp deduced$\backslash$nfrom travel times.},

	Abstract = {We present illustrative calculations of the effect of hemispherical variation in inner core anisotropy on Earth's normal modes of oscillation. Body wave studies show that the anisotropy in the inner core is not simple cylindrical anisotropy, which is often portrayed in models derived from normal mode data, but varies with longitude. `Hemispherical' or odd degree, structure has to be studied by cross-coupling normal modes, as the self-coupling technique is sensitive only to even degree Earth structure. A completely general definition of inner core anisotropy would require a prohibitive number of degrees of freedom; however, we show that any existing cylindrical anisotropy model can be confined to only one part of the inner core. Using our new theory, we find that hemispherical anisotropy causes significant changes in the frequency and quality factor of several inner core sensitive normal modes. The effect of hemispherical inner core anisotropy can also be seen in synthetic seismograms. Radial, PKIKP and PKJKP modes all respond to the presence of hemispherical variation in inner core anisotropy. If the variations in inner core anisotropy seen in body wave data are part of a gross, large-scale pattern, then this structure should also affect normal mode data on an observable scale.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed the splitting characteristics of 75 spheroidal free oscillations excited by the Great 1994 Bolivia and Kuril Islands earthquakes. These spheroidal modes may be roughly subdivided in terms of 8 radial modes, 40 mantle modes, and 27 core-sensitive modes. The splitting of each mode is corrected for the effects of rotation and hydrostatic ellipticity. The remaining signal is due to lateral variations in the mantle and core and may be expressed in terms of so-called splitting functions, which represent a local radial average of the Earth's even three-dimensional heterogeneity. In the surface-wave limit, splitting functions are the equivalent of an even-degree phase velocity map. Each mode is uniquely sensitive to the Earth's structure. Some modes are predominantly sensitive to compressional velocities in the upper mantle, others to shear velocity variations in the lowermost mantle, and some modes ''see'' the inner core. As part of our analysis, we determine the center frequency and quality factor of each individual mode; these observations constrain the terrestrial monopole. Collectively, the normal-mode splitting observations presented in this paper put constraints on the large-scale, even structure of the entire Earth. We compare the observed splitting functions with predictions from three recent Harvard models: SH12WM13, SKS12WM12, and PS12WM13. These models are constrained by traveltime and waveform data but contain no normal-mode information. We demonstrate that large-scale, even structure is quite accurately represented in current Earth models, but that the splitting of some predominantly compressional modes is not satisfactorily explained. Although a distinct mantle signal is observed in the splitting functions of core-sensitive modes, a characteristic zonal degree 2 pattern is missing. This missing signal is believed to be the result of inner core anisotropy.},

	Abstract = {The transient and impulse responses (Green's function) for one-dimensional wave propagation in a standard linear solid are calculated using a Laplace Transform method. The spectrum of relaxation times is chosen so as to model a constant Q medium within an absorption band covering a broad frequency range which may be chosen so as to include the seismic frequencies. The inverse transform may be evaluated asymptotically in the limit of very long propagation times using the saddle point method. For shorter propagation times the method of steepest descent may be modified so as to yield an accurate first motion approximation. The character of the small amplitude precursor to the large amplitude `visible' signal is investigated analytically. It is shown that the signal velocity is intermediate between the high-frequency (`unrelaxed') and the low-frequency (`relaxed') limits of the phase velocity.},

	Abstract = {We investigate one-dimensional waves in a standard linear solid for geophysically relevant ranges of the parameters. The critical parameters are shown to be T*= tu/Qm where tu is the travel time and Qm the quality factor in the absorption band, and $\tau$-1m, the high-frequency cut-off of the relaxation spectrum. The visual onset time, rise time, peak time, and peak amplitude are studied as functions of T* and $\tau$m. For very small $\tau$m, this model is shown to be very similar to previously proposed attenuation models. As $\tau$m grows past a critical value which depends on T*, the character of the attenuated pulse changes. Seismological implications of this model may be inferred by comparing body wave travel times with a `one second' earth model derived from long-period observations and corrected for attenuation effects assuming a frequency independent Q over the seismic band. From such a comparison we speculate that there may be a gap in the relaxation spectrum of the Earth's mantle for relaxation times shorter than about one second. However, observational constraints from the attenuation of body waves suggest that such a gap might in fact occur at higher frequencies. Such a hypothesis would imply a frequency dependence of Q in the Earth's mantle for short-period body waves.},

@article{Doornbos1983,
	Abstract = {Two types of observable consequences of the frequency dependence of Q (the absorption band concept) are discussed: (1) The observed waveform of a long-period body wave is systematically late compared to the synthetic purely elastic response. This observation can be made after the usual travel-time anomaly has been corrected for. (2) The short-period waveform of PKIKP sampling the inner core is systematically different from that of PKPBC bottoming above the inner core. This observation can be made at distances (147$\,^{\circ}$--151$\,^{\circ}$) where both phases are distinct, simple and similar apart from absorption effects.The long-period phase delay is measured on SRO/ASRO records of mantle P-waves from deep events, where the observed short-period onset is used to adjust the start time for the synthetic. The delay is caused by both absorption and source effects, and the two contributions are estimated in the context of a particular type of absorption and source model. If the Q model in PREM is representative of the long-period absorption, then the solution for the high-frequency cut-off of the absorption band (2$\pi$$\tau$1)-1 is near 0.2 Hz, but values up to 1 Hz cannot be absolutely ruled out by the data. Although this result represents the integrated effect of Q$\alpha$ in the mantle, for teleseismic P from deep events it should be more representative of Q$\alpha$ in the lower mantle. The characteristic change of waveform of short-period PKIKP with respect to PKPBC is observed on NORSAR array beams, and it can be explained by absorption on the low-frequency flank of an absorption band (or peak) in the inner core. This has the following implications: the low-frequency cut-off (2$\pi$$\tau$2)-1 of this band is above 2Hz. The minimum Q$\alpha$ in the centre of the band is likely to be below 100 in the upper 200km of the inner core. At body wave frequencies between 0.5 and 2.0 Hz, Q$\alpha$ varies here between about 600 and 200. With respect to this absorption band, inner core velocities inferred from observed short-period arrival times correspond to the relaxed elastic moduli, the unrelaxed moduli being inaccessible to observation. The intrinsic dissipation can be in shear and/or in bulk. The essential observational difference between relaxation models of shear dissipation and some diffusion models of bulk dissipation occurs on the high-frequency side of the absorption band. Hence, it is not possible to discriminate between the two mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {The concept of a relaxation spectrum is used to compute the absorption and dispersion of a linear anelastic solid. The Boltzmann after-effect equation is solved for a solid having a linear relationship between stress and strain and their first time derivatives, the `standard linear solid', and having a distribution of relaxation times. The distribution function is chosen to give a nearly constant Q over the seismic frequency range. Both discrete and continuous relaxation spectra are considered. The resulting linear solid has a broad absorption band which can be interpreted in terms of a superposition of absorption peaks of individual relaxation mechanisms.The accompanying phase and group velocity dispersion imply that one cannot directly compare body wave, surface wave, and free oscillation data or laboratory and seismic data without correcting for absorption. The necessary formalism for making these corrections is given. In the constant Q regions the correction is the same as that implied in the theories of Futterman, Lomnitz, Strick and Kolsky.},

	Abstract = {Conventional approaches to determine relative arrival times of body waves recorded by a local or a regional array rely on cross-correlations between pairs of traces. This problem is better posed as a non-linear inverse problem, which involves the minimization of a cost function that measures the difference between a reference unknown waveform that can be time delayed, and the observed data. The unknown parameters that are solved for, are the amplitude values at each time sample of the optimal waveform and its time delay defined for each trace. The problem, which has a large number of unknown parameters, is solved with simulated annealing. The algorithm is very efficient and can be used for a routine analysis of seismic data. The application of this method to several earthquakes recorded during different PASSCAL experiments demonstrates that it provides accurate and robust differential traveltime measurements even with very noisy data.},

A Gaussian distribution of P-wave velocity fluctuations with the standard deviations of 5{\%}, 6{\%}, and 7{\%} in the uppermost 200 km of the inner core is superimposed on the velocity structure that is slightly faster than the typical structure in the Eastern Hemisphere, which is likely to explain both the travel time and amplitude data as far as only the one-dimensional structure is considered.

	Abstract = {P4KP-PcP differential travel times are examined to infer the core-mantle boundary (CMB) topography. A total of 362 P4KP-PcP times are measured with a measurement error of 0.5 s. The travel times are corrected for the Earth's hydrostatic ellipticity and mantle heterogeneity using a P-wave tomographic model. Spherical harmonic expansion up to degree 4 is adopted for model parameterization. The P-wave velocity heterogeneity is then estimated in the lowermost 150 km of the mantle to overcome the problem of underestimation of the velocity perturbation at the base of the mantle in the global 3-D P-wave mantle model. Subsequently, the CMB topography is inferred using the residues of the above processes. Since the odd-degree components of the CMB topography are insensitive to the P4KP-PcP times, only the components of degrees 2 and 4 are solved for. The resultant features indicate that the maximum amplitude of the CMB topography does not exceed $\pm$2 km, with an uncertainty of less than 0.5 km. A numerical test confirms that the pattern of degree 4 is more reliable with less amplitude recovery. The obtained degree 4 pattern shows an amplitude of less than $\pm$1 km and indicates the presence of depressions under the circum-Pacific, the central Pacific, and South Africa.},

	Abstract = {PKP-Cdiff is a compressional wave diffracting around the inner core boundary (ICB), which may contain much information on the structure of the ICB. Here I have determined the slowness of PKP-Cdiff and its coda with small-aperture arrays to approach the unsettled issues on the origin of PKP-Cdiff coda. Short-period seismic array data were analyzed using beam forming as function of slowness and back azimuths. The analysis was applied to band-pass filtered array records for 16 frequency bands with central values of 0.25--4.0 Hz. The difference of array response functions were adjusted by using the phase weighted stack with large power indexes of the phase stack. The stacking analysis resulted in enough slowness resolution in the higher frequency range of 1--4 Hz, PKP-Cdiff coda was identified as an assembly of coherent signals. PKP-Cdiff coda lasted longer than the duration of PKP-AB, suggesting that PKP-Cdiff coda is independent of source time function and/or site effects. The slowness of PKP-Cdiff coda was distributed from 1 to 5 s/deg with blunt peaks at 2, 3 and 4 s/deg, whereas those of PKP-DF and PKP-AB were relatively concentrated in narrow ranges around 1--2 and 4--5 s/deg, respectively. The slowness larger than 2 s/deg and travel times of the PKP-Cdiff coda can be explained by scattering of PKP waves near the caustic at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Especially, the slowness of the scattering waves from the source side CMB is close to that from the ICB and it is difficult to distinguish them. In order to obtain secure observations of PKP-Cdiff coda from the ICB, we better avoid analyzing an event that is located over strong heterogeneities at the CMB.},

The SmKS phases analyzed in this study travel in the mantle with weak heterogeneity confirmed by a global tomographic study for the distance range of 115--135$\,^{\circ}$. The SmKS differential times were obtained from a vespagram (a stack intensity on a time-slowness diagram), and comparison with the vespagram created from synthetic waveforms with PREM gives the travel-time residual for each event-array pair. Although the residuals of S3KS--S2KS times exhibit apparently a systematic dependence on epicentral distance, this is likely due to small-scale heterogeneity beneath the Oceania where is covered by the SmKS ray entering points at the CMB. Waveform modeling was applied to a record section with a small travel-time residual that suggests a small effect from the mantle heterogeneity on the data set, I found that a low-velocity zone in the outermost 50 km in the core rather than PREM can explain an additional arrival detected just after the S3KS phase. This result is still inconclusive because of the small number of data and non-uniqueness of the model and ambiguity due to mantle structure. However, accumulation of the precise measurement described in this study may help the reduction of uncertainty and trade-offs.},

The events used for this study occur in the western Pacific Rim (New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon, New Guinea, Philippine Islands) and are recorded at the short-period Yellowknife Array (YKA) in northern Canada. The source--receiver combination results in PP reflection points which allow us to study the upper mantle structure in a corridor from the Hawaiian Islands to the Kuril subduction zone. To detect the weak precursors in the time window between the P arrival and the PP onset and to identify them as PP underside reflections, special array techniques are used. Our analysis indicates a reflector at a depth of ∼200 km beneath the northwestern Pacific. This reflector shows strong topography of some tens of kilometres on length scales of several hundred kilometres, complicating the detection of this reflector in global or regional stacks of seismograms. Different models for the impedance jump across the reflector, the thickness and the possible fine structure of the reflector are modelled using synthetic seismograms and are compared with the data. The thickness of the reflector has to be less than 7 km and the P wave impedance contrast has to be larger than 5.0--6.5 per cent to be detected by this study. This corresponds to a P-velocity jump of ∼4 per cent assuming the PREM density model.},

It is possible to place constraints on the magnitude of such heterogeneities by identifying seismic phases multiply reflected within the Earth's core. The value of such a simple technique is illustrated by using array recordings of P and S5KP waves that have traversed the bottom of the mantle beneath Hawaii to show that there is no clear evidence for the unusual physical properties attributed to this region of the Earth. Identification of the phase S7KP is also reported.},

The antipodal waveform data are highly variable between axes. The observed variability of the waveforms indicates global variations in the structure above and below the Inner-Outer Core boundary region. We have found evidence for a regional low-velocity zone at the base of the Outer Core, corresponding with a decadal temporal variation (0.55 s) in seismic energy traversing the top of the Inner Core.

	Abstract = {We present a nonlinear waveform inversion method to determine source parameters under point‐source approximation (depth, source time function, centroid moment tensor, and seismic moment) and also travel times and amplitudes of body waves from teleseismic records. We demonstrate that our source time function estimates significantly improve correlation between observed and synthetics broadband seismograms. The scaling of source dimensions with seismic moment is similar for deep and shallow events in the Japanese subduction area for moment magnitudes between 6.1 and 7.5. We compare event depths and moment tensors obtained with our method to those reported by different institutions for a set of Japanese earthquakes. This comparison reveals that our method gives hypocentral depths closer to those obtained with regional arrays than other teleseismic methods. The seismic moment is properly recovered, but data weighting strongly influences the moment tensor solution. Focal mechanisms are biased by high‐frequency body‐wave amplitude variations due to crustal structure below the stations and by errors on the instrument responses. Body‐wave differential travel times are improved compared with phase‐picking measurements. The high‐quality travel times will be exploited to obtain more precise event locations and higher resolution tomographic models.Online Material: Coordinates of Japanese earthquakes processed in this study.},

	Abstract = {We present an extension of the previously developed algorithm for Simulated Annealing Waveform Inversion of Body waves (SAWIB) to resolve the interference between direct PKP seismic phases and their corresponding depth phases (pPKP and sPKP) which occurs for shallow earthquakes. This allows us to process shallow earthquakes previously discarded by the analysts, and therefore improve spatial sampling of the deep Earth by PKP phases. The SAWIB algorithm is applied to available waveform data to determine PKP travel times and amplitudes. The new data set of PKP travel times and amplitudes is significantly larger than previous ones. PKP (bc--df) differential travel time residuals display a hemispherical pattern in the inner core when plotted as a function of the angle between PKPdf propagation direction in the inner core and Earth's rotation axis. Most anomalous differential travel times are along polar paths in the quasi-western hemisphere (180 $\,^{\circ}$W--40 $\,^{\circ}$E), corresponding to earthquakes in the South Sandwich Islands recorded at northern seismic stations. PKP (ab--df) differential travel times display a larger scatter, which we attribute to heterogeneities at the base of the mantle. Relative amplitudes and t* attenuation parameters are analyzed in terms of inner core attenuation. The inner core attenuation decreases with increasing depth. In the upper inner core, in the depth range 150--220 km, an hemispherical pattern appears with a quasi-western hemisphere (40 $\,^{\circ}$E--180 $\,^{\circ}$E) faster and more attenuating than the rest of the inner core. When stacking PKP waveforms deconvolved by their source time function, we do not find evidence of a global innermost inner core velocity discontinuity. However we cannot rule out the existence of strong local heterogeneities or radial anisotropy variations from our data.},

@article{Tkalcic2015,
	Abstract = {The days when the Earth's inner core (IC) was viewed as a homogenous solid sphere surrounded by the liquid outer core (OC) are now behind us. Due to a limited number of data sampling the IC and a lack of experimentally controlled conditions in the deep Earth studies, it has been difficult to scrutinize competitive hypotheses in this active area of research. However, a number of new concepts linking IC structure and dynamics has been proposed lately to explain different types of seismological observations.A common denominator of recent observational work on the IC is increased complexity seen in IC physical properties such as its isotropic and anisotropic structure, attenuation, inner core boundary (ICB) topography, and its rotational dynamics. For example, small-scale features have been observed to exist as a widespread phenomenon in the uppermost inner core (UIC), probably superimposed on much longer-scale features. The characterization of small-scale features sheds light on the nature of the solidification process and helps understanding seismologically observed hemispherical dichotomy of the IC. The existence of variations in the rate and level of solidification is a plausible physical outcome in an environment where vigorous compositional convection in the OC and variations in heat exchange across the ICB may control the process of crystal growth. However, further progress is hindered by the fact that the current travel time data of PKIKP waves traversing the IC do not allow discriminating between variations in isotropic P-wave velocity and velocity anisotropy. Future studies of attenuation in the IC might provide crucial information about IC structure, although another trade-off exists - that of the relative contribution of scattering versus viscoelastic attenuation and the connection with the material properties. Future installations of dense arrays, cross-paths of waves that sample the IC, and corresponding array-studies will be a powerful tool to image and clearly distinguish between viscoelasticand scattering attenuation, and isotropic- and anisotropic-heterogeneity related effects on travel times of core-sensitive body waves. This will then inevitably contribute to a better understanding of what the IC is made of, how it solidifies and how it contributes to the generation and dynamics of the geomagnetic field.},

@article{JGRB:JGRB10466,
	Abstract = {Pn travel times are affected not only by lateral variations in crust and mantle velocity but also by significant amounts of laterally varying anisotropy. To investigate uppermost mantle anisotropy, a tomography algorithm was reformulated to include lateral variations in both velocity and horizontal anisotropy, and it was applied to Pn travel time data from the western United States. Results show that anisotropy is as important in explaining the travel time residuals as are the velocity variations. A detailed resolution study examined the trade-off between the velocity variations and the anisotropy variations and showed that both could be resolved for regions with good ray path coverage. Pn anisotropy beneath the western United States has maximum amplitudes of $\pm$0.3 km/s (7.5{\%}) when resolved on a length scales of around 3$\,^{\circ}$. The orientations of Pn anisotropy often correlate well with those inferred from shear-wave splitting results. This correlation suggests that orientation of mantle anisotropy does not change significantly with depth for many regions. The orientation of the Pn anisotropy can be correlated with some of the tectonic processes which occur within the western United States. For example, the fast direction of Pn anisotropy parallels the northeast direction of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath the northwest Pacific coast, suggesting that there the anisotropy is related to subduction-driven deformation. The fast direction of Pn anisotropy also parallels the strike of the San Andreas Fault system in central California, indicating that shear strains along the plate boundary may be responsible for the anisotropy there. Within the Great Basin, the Pn anisotropy varies substantially, and both partial melting and small-scale convection within the uppermost mantle could be responsible for these anisotropy variations.},

@article{JGRB:JGRB8232,
	Abstract = {We have made measurements of shear wave splitting in the phases SKS and SKKS at 21 broadband stations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Measurements are made using a retrieval scheme that yields the azimuth of the fast polarization direction ϕ and delay time $\delta$t of the split shear wave plus uncertainties. Detectable anisotropy was found at most stations, suggesting that it is a general feature of the subcontinental mantle. Delay times range from 0.65 s to 1.70 s and average about 1 s. Somewhat surprisingly, the largest delay time is found in the 2.7 b.y.-old Western Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. The splitting observations are interpreted in terms of the strain-induced lattice preferred orientation of mantle minerals, especially olivine. We consider three hypotheses concerning the origin of the continental anisotropy: (1) strain associated with absolute plate motion, as in the oceanic upper mantle, (2) crustal stress, and (3) the past and present internal deformation of the subcontinental upper mantle by tectonic episodes. It is found that the last hypothesis is the most successful, namely that the most recent significant episode of internal deformation appears to be the best predictor of ϕ. For stable continental regions, this is interpreted as ``fossil'' anisotropy, whereas for presently active regions, such as Alaska, the anisotropy reflects present-day tectonic activity. In the stable portion of North America there is a good correlation between delay time and lithospheric thickness; this is consistent with the anisotropy being localized in the subcontinental lithosphere and suggests that intrinsic anisotropy is approximately constant. The acceptance of this hypothesis has several implications for subcontinental mantle deformation. First, it argues for coherent deformation of the continental lithosphere (crust and mantle) during orogenies. This implies that the anisotropic portion of the lithosphere was present since the deformational episode and rules out the addition of undeformed material to this layer by subsequent ``underplating'' or conductive growth of the thermal boundary layer. One of the most important issues in the study of orogenies is the need to reconcile the formation of thickened lithosphere with the paradoxically high mantle temperatures often associated with orogenic episodes. Most efforts to date have focussed on modes of deformation whereby the cold lithospheric mantle is removed (by convective instability or delamination) and replaced by warm asthenosphere. These models, however, are incompatible with the evidence for preserved coherent lithospheric deformation; rather, the deformed mantle appears to have been heated in place. We suggest that the elevated mantle temperatures may be due to the strain heating accompanying the deformation.},

@article{ROG:ROG1506,
	Abstract = {Shear wave splitting measurements now allow us to examine deformation in the lithosphere and upper asthenosphere with lateral resolution {\textless}50 km. In an anisotropic medium, one component of a shear wave travels faster than the orthogonal component. The difference in speed causes the waves to separate; this phenomenon is called shear wave splitting. The polarization of the fast component and the time delay between the components provide simple measurements to characterize the anisotropy. Strain aligns highly anisotropic olivine crystals in the mantle, which is the most likely cause of splitting measured from records of distant earthquakes. The seismic community is in the fundamental stages of determining the relations between strain and anisotropy, measuring anisotropy around the world, and determining how much is formed by past and present lithospheric deformation and how much is formed by crustal and asthenospheric sources. The mantle appears isotropic between 600 km depth and the D″ layer at the top of the core-mantle boundary. Shear wave anisotropy of up to 4{\%} is ubiquitous in the upper 200 km of the crust and mantle. Evidence for stronger and deeper anisotropy is less common. Anisotropy in the transition zone between 400 and 600 km and in the D″ layer may be patchy. Transcurrent deformation at plate boundaries appears to be one of the best mechanisms for causing splitting on nearly vertically traveling waves by aligning foliation planes and the fast axes of olivine within the lithosphere parallel to the boundary and in the most favorable orientation for splitting. Similar deformation may also contribute to anisotropy observed at convergent margins. Shear wave splitting data are challenging conventional beliefs about mantle flow. Simple models of asthenosphere diverging at spreading centers and flowing downward beneath subduction zones appear to be only part of the story, with significant components of flow parallel to ridges and trenches. Parallelism between fast polarizations of waves passing through the deep mantle beneath cratons and surficial geological strain indicators has been used to suggest that the mantle at depths of several hundred kilometers beneath the cratons may have been stable since the initial deformation in the Archean. New paths of investigation include testing a wider range of anisotropic symmetry systems and more complicated models by examining variations in splitting as a function of earthquake arrival angle and distance and by numerical modeling of waveforms and of proposed deformation scenarios.},

	Abstract = {We analyze short-period PKP precursor wave trains recorded at Global Digital Seismograph Network stations in the distance range 120$\,^{\circ}$ {\textless} $\Delta$ {\textless} 140$\,^{\circ}$ to infer the nature of inhomogeneities near the core-mantle boundary. Travel times and particle motions are consistent with predictions of single-scattered waves near the CMB. The dominant frequencies are around 1 Hz. The regions best sampled are beneath Indonesia, North America, Central Africa, and South America. Based on first-order scattering theory, the characteristics of the wave number spectrum of the structural inhomogeneities are obtained for two hypotheses: volume inhomogeneities and topographic irregularities. For the range of wavelengths sampled by these data (between 10 and 70 km), the spectrum of inhomogeneities is best represented by a power law of index 5.3 for volume inhomogeneities and 6.8 for topographic irregularities. If the scattering is due only to volumetric inhomogeneities, we estimate the strength of the structural variations to be about 0.5{\%} in P wave velocity for a 200-km-thick layer. If the scattering is due only to topographic irregularities, the topography has an rms height of 280 m. At present we can not distinguish between these two types of inhomogeneities.},

The detection of these scattered waves in data from small aperture arrays is new and allows a better characterization of the fine-scale structure of the deep Earth especially in the southern hemisphere. Their slowness vector is determined from array processing allowing location of the heterogeneities at the core--mantle boundary using back-projection techniques through 1D Earth models. We identify strong scattering at the core--mantle boundary (CMB) beneath the Caribbean, Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula as well as beneath southern Africa. An analysis of the scattering regions relative to sources and receivers indicates that these regions represent areas of increased scattering likely due to increased heterogeneities close to the CMB. The 1{\&}{\#}xa0;Hz array data used in this study is most sensitive to heterogeneity with scale lengths of about 10{\&}{\#}xa0;km. Given the small size of the scatterers, a chemical origin of the heterogeneities is likely.

	Abstract = {Scattering by a slightly-rough core-mantle boundary (CMB) with small-scale radial variations of up to a few hundred metres, has been an attractive (though non-unique) interpretation of at least part of the precursors to PKIKP. Here it is shown that a slightly-rough {\{}CMB{\}} has an observable effect on {\{}PKKP{\}} as well, if the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. The effect may be observed as precursive arrivals and is due to back-scattering at CMB. This work was prompted by observations by Chang and Cleary at {\{}LASA{\}} of ``PKKP'' and precursors from the Novaya Zemlya explosions. {\{}NORSAR{\}} data from several source regions are presented here; small-scale radial variations of 100--200 metres are inferred from these data, although in some regions the {\{}CMB{\}} appears to be much smoother. On the other hand, the {\{}LASA{\}} data are anomalous and suggest much larger topography in the sampled region of the CMB. Both large- and small-scale topography must be dynamically produced, if current estimates of the viscosity of the lower mantle (∼1022 Poise) are correct.},

	Abstract = {We use a total of 839,369 PcP, PKPab, PKPbc, PKPdf, PKKPab, and {\{}PKKPbc{\}} residual travel times from [Bull. Seism. Soc. Am. 88 (1998) 722] grouped in 29,837 summary rays to constrain lateral variation in the depth to the core--mantle boundary (CMB). We assumed a homogeneous outer core, and the data were corrected for mantle structure and inner-core anisotropy. Inversions of separate data sets yield amplitude variations of up to 5{\&}{\#}xa0;km for PcP, PKPab, PKPbc, and {\{}PKKP{\}} and 13{\&}{\#}xa0;km for PKPdf. This is larger than the {\{}CMB{\}} undulations inferred in geodetic studies and, moreover, the PcP results are not readily consistent with the inferences from {\{}PKP{\}} and PKKP. Although the source--receiver ambiguity for the core-refracted phases can explain some of it, this discrepancy suggest that the travel-time residuals cannot be explained by topography alone. The wavespeed perturbations in the tomographic model used for the mantle corrections might be too small to fully account for the trade off between volumetric heterogeneity and {\{}CMB{\}} topography. In a second experiment we therefore re-applied corrections for mantle structure outside a basal 290{\&}{\#}xa0;km-thick layer and inverted all data jointly for both {\{}CMB{\}} topography and volumetric heterogeneity within this layer. The resultant {\{}CMB{\}} model can explain PcP, PKP, and {\{}PKKP{\}} residuals and has approximately 0.2{\&}{\#}xa0;km excess core ellipticity, which is in good agreement with inferences from free core nutation observations. Joint inversion yields a peak-to-peak amplitude of {\{}CMB{\}} topography of about 3{\&}{\#}xa0;km, and the inversion yields velocity variations of $\pm$5{\%} in the basal layer. The latter suggests a strong trade-off between topography and volumetric heterogeneity, but uncertainty analyses suggest that the variation in core radius can be resolved. The spherical averages of all inverted topographic models suggest that the data are best fit if the actual {\{}CMB{\}} radius is 1.5{\&}{\#}xa0;km less than in the Earth reference model used (i.e. the average outer core radius would be 3478{\&}{\#}xa0;km).},

	Abstract = {We apply the modern theory of radiative transfer to the modeling of the global propagation of high-frequency seismic waves in the Earth. This theory stems from an exact statistical treatment of the wave equation and incorporates rigorously the effects of multiple scattering. The statistical mean time between scattering events (the mean free time) and the typical correlation length of the random fluctuations (the scale length) are introduced as the fundamental parameters of the theory. The integro-differential equation of transport describes statistically the propagation of energy in phase space and can be conveniently solved by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We provide a general description of the method, stressing the important modifications required to adapt it to global propagation. The theory is applied to the modeling of PKP precursors, probably the best documented examples of wave scattering at the global scale. Guided by recent results of Hedlin et al. [1997], we solve the transfer equation in a variety of Earth models presenting exponentially correlated fluctuations of elastic parameters superimposed upon PREM. The validity of Born approximation is tested in a series of random media with mean free time and scale length in the 100--3200 s and 4--24 km ranges, respectively. For errors in coda envelope amplitude bound by 20{\%}, the Born approximation can be safely applied in media with mean free times larger than about 400 s, relatively independent of the scale length. This corresponds to rather moderate ({\textless}0.5{\%} RMS) perturbations, thus severely limiting the range of validity of Born approximation.},

	Abstract = {We apply the theory of radiative transfer to invert for the small-scale structure of the mantle, by fitting mean amplitude envelopes of precursors to PKP in the time domain. The data set previously used by Hedlin and Shearer [2000] have been augmented with new deep events from the 1997--2000 period, thereby doubling the number of high-quality records selected for this study. Regional and global average amplitudes are measured in six bins covering the 124--142$\,^{\circ}$ epicentral distance range. The inversion focuses on stacks for strongly scattering wave paths only and aims to determine the depth extent and power spectrum of the mantle heterogeneities that cause the scattered signals. We find that the restriction of scatterers to the D″ layer is incompatible with observations. Instead, whole mantle scattering models reproduce with reasonable accuracy the time dependence of precursors, in agreement with previous findings. Exponential correlations predict a spatial rate of decay of the precursor amplitude which is much faster than observed. Thus we are led to propose a new model of mantle heterogeneity, richer in small-scale than exponential media, that fits uniformly the data. An analytic form of the correlation function and power spectrum of our new model is given explicitly. It is shown that the precise length scale of heterogeneities is fundamentally unresolvable because of the limited range of observations. The perturbations in P wave velocities required to fit the data are only of order 0.1--0.2{\%}, which is more than 1 order of magnitude less than found in previous studies.},

Envelope‐stacking methods applied to large teleseismic databases are useful for resolving the globally averaged time and amplitude dependence of these arrivals. Stacks of P coda near 1 Hz from shallow earthquakes exhibit significant variations among different source and receiver locations, indicating lateral variations in scattering strength. At least some deep‐mantle, core‐mantle boundary, and inner‐core scattering is indicated by the observations, but the strength and scale length of the random velocity heterogeneity required to explain the data are not yet firmly established. Monte Carlo seismic ``particle'' algorithms, based on numerical evaluation of radiative transfer theory with Born scattering amplitudes for random elastic heterogeneity, provide a powerful tool for computer modeling of scattering in the whole Earth because they preserve energy and can handle multiple scattering through depth‐varying heterogeneity models. Efficient implementation of these algorithms can be achieved by precomputing ray tracing tables and discretized scattering probability functions.},

	Abstract = {Recent results suggest that an iron-rich oxide may have fractionally crystallized from a primordial magma ocean and settled on the core--mantle boundary (CMB). Based on experimental results, the presence of only a few percent of Fe-rich oxide could slow seismic waves down by several percent. This heavy layer can become highly undulating as predicted from dynamic modeling but can remain as a distinct structure with uniform velocity reductions. Here, we use the large {\{}USArray{\}} seismic network to search for such structures. Strong constraints on D″ are provided by the core-phase {\{}SKS{\}} where it bifurcates, containing a short segment of P-wave diffractions (Pd) when crossing the CMB, called SKSd. Synthetics from models with moderate velocity drops (less than 10{\%}) involving a layer with variable thickness, perhaps a composite of sharp small structures, with strong variation in thickness can explain both the observed {\{}SKSd{\}} waveforms and large scatter in differential times between {\{}SKKS{\}} and SKS. A smooth 3D image is obtained from inverting {\{}SKSd{\}} waveforms displaying rolling-hills with elongated dome-like structures sitting on the CMB. The most prominent one has an 80-km height, ∼8$\,^{\circ}$ length, and ∼4$\,^{\circ}$ width, thus adding still more structural complexity to the lower mantle. We suggest that these results can be explained by a dynamically-stabilized material containing small amounts (∼5{\%}) iron-rich (Mg,Fe)O providing a self-consistent physical interpretation.},

	Abstract = {The fine scale structure of the core mantle boundary (CMB) region beneath southern Alaska is studied using core reflected P-waves (PcP) recorded at the Canadian Yellowknife array. Seismic studies of the lowermost mantle have detected a multitude of structures at this contact zone between iron alloy liquid of the core and the silicates of the mantle. These structures offer key constraints for the dynamics of mantle and core. High quality waveform information and migrated array data have been used to infer the existence of thin layering at the {\{}CMB{\}} in the form of ultra-low velocity zones. The data clearly show the absence of an ultra-low velocity zone thicker than about 7{\&}{\#}xa0;km in this region while there is evidence for a weak P-wave reflector about 110{\&}{\#}xa0;km above the {\{}CMB{\}} beneath the Kenai peninsula. These observations are in good agreement with the hypothesis that ultra-low velocity zones are related to areas with lower than average seismic velocities in tomographic images and absent in regions of fast seismic velocities likely related to subduction processes such as beneath Alaska.},

	Abstract = {Data from a western United States short-period seismic network are investigated in order to detect anomalous later P-wave arrivals within a time window from 50{\&}{\#}xa0;s to 170{\&}{\#}xa0;s after direct P waves for deep and intermediate-depth earthquakes at circum-Pacific subduction zones. We interpret the anomalous arrivals as S-to-P scattered waves from heterogeneities in the mid-lower mantle. The searched regions (depths from ∼800{\&}{\#}xa0;km to 2200{\&}{\#}xa0;km) cover approximately 2{\%} of the entire lower mantle. The heterogeneous scattering objects are located by array processing of the seismic waves using semblance, with careful investigations of arrival time, slowness and azimuth of the later phases relative to direct P waves. We usually observe two or three later phases which are separated in arrival time by 5--20{\&}{\#}xa0;s and have similar arrival azimuth and slowness. This observation suggests that a few scatterers often form a cluster with a typical spacing of 100--200{\&}{\#}xa0;km vertically. More than ten clusters or groups of S-to-P scattering objects are detected in the mid-lower mantle beneath the circum-Pacific regions; northern Kuril, Izu-Bonin, Mariana, northern Fiji, and west coast of South America. The S-to-P scattering objects are found in a depth range from 1100 to 1800{\&}{\#}xa0;km, and the most prominent objects of each region tend to be located around the middle of the depth range. The amplitudes of the scattered waves range from 1{\%} to 10{\%} of the direct P waves, with exceptionally large values as large as 40{\%}. The associated magnitudes of the changes in elasticity is not tightly constrained but probably are nearly 1{\%} and may occasionally exceed 4{\%} of shear velocity. Considering their high efficiency at converting short-period waves (wavelengths of 5--10{\&}{\#}xa0;km), the changes in elastic properties at the heterogeneous objects appear to occur within several kilometers. Seismic tomography studies have not detected prominent seismic wave speed anomalies except for those beneath South America which appear to be located in the former Farallon plate and those at north of Fiji which appear to be located around the Pacific superplume. The mid-lower mantle heterogeneity should represent sharp chemical variations in major element composition of the lower mantle rocks. The most plausible tectonic explanation of the variations is remnant of subducted and folded former oceanic crust which preceded the current subduction of the Pacific plate. The extreme estimates of low shear velocity ({\textgreater}4{\%}) may indicate the prominent drops in the shear modulus due to ferro-elastic phase transition in stishovite (SiO2). Our observations imply that heterogeneity of kilometer-scale persists for billions of years despite of stirring due to convection and therefore is ubiquitous in the lower mantle. It is qualitatively consistent with some recent convection models.},

	Abstract = {Recent observations of inner-core scattering (ICS) waves provide evidence that the outermost 300 km of the inner-core has strong heterogeneities with a length scale of a few kilometers. These waves follow a path similar to that of the inner-core--reflected waves PKiKP and were originally observed in data from 16 events in the distance range 58$\,^{\circ}$ to 73$\,^{\circ}$ recorded by the Large Aperture Seismic Array (LASA). Here we present additional observations of the ICS waves from a total of 78 events recorded by LASA at distances from 18$\,^{\circ}$ to 98$\,^{\circ}$. We use a modified version of the Generic Array Processing software package to identify ICS waves on the basis of travel time, back azimuth, ray parameter, amplitude, and coherence. There are 44 events that produce clear ICS waves. We then perform forward modeling of the observed ICS waves using a Monte Carlo seismic phonon method that allows for multiple scattering along the raypath. Most of the ICS waves appear without a visible PKiKP phase, initially grow in time, and have a spindle-shaped envelope. The duration, risetime, and decay rates of the observed ICS waves can be best explained by small-scale volumetric heterogeneities in the outermost few hundred kilometers of the inner core. The average Qc value for the 44 events is ∼600. Most clear ICS waves are found for raypaths sampling the Pacific Ocean and Asia, and relatively few observations are from the Atlantic Ocean, roughly consistent with the recently observed hemispheric difference in the inner-core structure.},

	Abstract = {The anisotropy of heterogeneity scale lengths in the lower mantle is investigated by modelling its effect on the high-frequency precursors of PKIKP scattered by the heterogeneities. Although models having either an isotropic or an anisotropic distribution of scale lengths can fit the observed coda shapes of short-period precursors, the frequency content of broad-band PKIKP precursors favours a dominantly isotropic distribution of scale lengths. Precursor coda shapes are consistent with 1 per cent fluctuations in P velocity in the wavenumber band 0.05--0.5km−1 extending to 1000km above the core--mantle boundary, and with a D″ region open to circulation throughout the lower mantle. The level of excitation of PKIKP precursors observed in the frequency band 0.02--2Hz requires a power spectrum of heterogeneity that is nearly white or slowly increasing with wavenumber. Anisotropy of scale lengths may exist in a D″ layer having larger horizontal than vertical scale lengths and produce little or no detectable effects on PKIKP precursors for P-velocity perturbations as high as 3 per cent when averaged over a vertical scale of several kilometres, and much higher when averaged over scales of hundreds of metres or less.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the utility of {\{}PKP{\}} coda waves for studying weak scattering from small-scale heterogeneity in the mid-mantle. Coda waves are potentially a useful probe of heterogeneity in the mid-mantle because they are not preferentially scattered near the CMB, as {\{}PKP{\}} precursors are, but are sensitive to scattering at all depths. {\{}PKP{\}} coda waves have not been used for this purpose historically because of interference with other late-arriving energy due to near-surface resonance and scattering. Any study of deep mantle scattering using coda waves requires the removal of near-surface effects from the data. We have analyzed 3624 recordings of {\{}PKP{\}} precursors and coda made by stations in the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Global Seismographic Network (GSN). To study the range and time dependence of the scattered waves, we binned and stacked envelopes of the recordings. We have considered precursors that arrive within a 20{\&}{\#}xa0;s window before {\{}PKP{\}} and coda waves in a 60{\&}{\#}xa0;s window after PKP. The {\{}PKP{\}} scattered waves increase in amplitude rapidly with range as predicted by scattering theory. At ranges below ∼125$\,^{\circ}$, we predict and observe essentially no scattered energy preceding PKP. Coda amplitudes at these ranges are independent of range and provide an estimate of energy due to near-surface effects that we can expect at all ranges. We use the average coda amplitude at ranges from 120 to 125$\,^{\circ}$ to correct coda amplitudes at other ranges. {\{}PKP{\}} coda waves show a strong dependence on time and range and are clearly influenced by scattering in the lower mantle. {\{}PKP{\}} coda waves, however, do not provide a tighter constraint on the vertical distribution of mantle heterogeneity than is provided by precursors. This is due, in part, to relatively large scatter in coda amplitudes as revealed by a resampling analysis. Modeling using Rayleigh--Born scattering theory and an exponential autocorrelation function shows that {\{}PKP{\}} coda amplitudes are not highly sensitive to the vertical distribution of heterogeneity in the mantle. To illustrate this we consider single-scattering in two extreme models of mantle heterogeneity. One allows heterogeneity just at the CMB; the other includes heterogeneity throughout the mantle. The amplitudes of precursors are tightly constrained by our stack and support our earlier conclusion that small-scale heterogeneity is uniformly distributed throughout the lower mantle. The best-fit model includes 8{\&}{\#}xa0;km scale length heterogeneity with an rms velocity contrast throughout the mantle of 1{\%}.},

	Abstract = {High-frequency precursors to the core phase PKP are caused by scattering off heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle and D″ regions, and they provide a unique window into the small-scale structure of the deep Earth. We study lower mantle scattering by analyzing 412 high-quality PKP precursor records at ranges between 120$\,^{\circ}$ and 137.5$\,^{\circ}$ as obtained from the global seismic networks during the last 10 years. To examine regional variations in scattering strength, we compare individual records with the globally averaged PKP precursor stack of Hedlin et al.. [1997]. We identify strong differences in apparent scattering strength among specific source-receiver paths. Inversion of these data for scattering source regions is complicated by ambiguity between source- and receiver-side scattering and the sparse and uneven data coverage. Synthetic tests, however, suggest that inversions with applied smoothness constraints can resolve large-scale differences in scattering strength over significant parts of the lower mantle. We use a conjugate gradient method based on an approximation to Rayleigh-Born scattering theory to image differences in the average strength of scattering within the lowermost 1000 km of the mantle. Our results indicate particularly strong scattering beneath central Africa, parts of North America, and just north of India, whereas weaker scattering is seen beneath South and Central America, eastern Europe, and Indonesia. Some regions of strong scattering correlate roughly with large-scale anomalies revealed by seismic tomography including the African plume and the Tethys trench. These correlations are tentative rather than definitive because bootstrap resampling tests show that many details in our model are not reliably resolved and the network data alone do not permit complete resolution of the source-receiver ambiguity in all areas. Further progress in this area will require integration of available network recordings with data collected by regional networks and arrays and consideration of the phase velocity of the precursors as well as their temporal variations.},

The comparison of the noise correlations with earthquake data confirms that the observed waves can be interpreted as P and S waves reflected from the Moho. Because the crustal model of the area is well known, we also compared the noise correlations with synthetic seismograms, and found an excellent agreement between the travel times of all the observed phases.

	Abstract = {Abstract Lateral heterogeneities at the top of the inner core are investigated using earthquakes that occurred in Indonesia and southeast Asia and were recorded in the southeastern Caribbean. Using seismic observations of attenuation and seismic velocity, we were able to constrain the characteristics of the boundary between the inner and outer core to further investigate the dynamics and evolution of the Earth's core. Our seismic observations from core phases confirm that the outermost inner core is asymmetrically heterogeneous and we are able to further constrain the morphology and physical properties of this layer. Comparison of data from earthquakes with ray paths traversing from east to the west versus those with ray paths from west to east allow us to map the aspherical heterogeneity of the boundary layer and specifically image the boundary between the proposed quasi-eastern and western hemispheres of the inner core. The variation of differential travel times between {\{}PKPdf{\}} and PKPbc, attenuation in terms of Q factor, and latitudinal changes for both of these observations, can be attributed to localized heterogeneity at the quasi-hemispherical boundaries of the inner core. We constrain the change in the thickness of outermost core boundary layer from 100 to 250{\&}{\#}xa0;km within a distance of a few 10s of kilometers at 45$\,^{\circ}$E{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;2$\,^{\circ}$, for the western boundary, with an overall P-wave velocity decrease in the western hemisphere of 0.5{\%} and increase of 0.5{\%} in the eastern hemisphere. We constrain the eastern boundary at latitudes greater than 45$\,^{\circ}$N to 173$\,^{\circ}$E{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;4$\,^{\circ}$ with an overall P-wave velocity decrease in the western hemisphere of 1.0{\%} in the uppermost 200{\&}{\#}xa0;km of the inner core. The eastern boundary at equatorial latitudes is constrained to a region {\textless}170$\,^{\circ}$E with a western hemisphere with a 0.5{\%} drop in P-wave velocity in the uppermost 250{\&}{\#}xa0;km. },

We forward model the stacked precursor envelope with an energy-conserving, multiple-scattering algorithm to find that an rms velocity perturbation of ∼0.1 per cent fits the data reasonably well, in agreement with Margerin {\&} Nolet. Similar results can be obtained using single-scattering (Born) theory, given the relatively weak scattering produced by our preferred model. The ramp-like increase in PKP precursor amplitudes with time is best fit with whole mantle scattering rather than models where scattering is restricted to the core--mantle boundary. Correctly modelling the relative amplitude of PKP precursor amplitudes compared to PKPdf requires taking into account the pulse broadening and coda of PKPdf, which can be done either empirically or by including a strongly scattering lithospheric layer in the multiple-scattering code. Several mantle scattering models proposed to explain other scattered seismic phases predict PKP precursor amplitudes much larger than those observed.},

	Abstract = {Studies of velocity structure in the Earth's inner core and its volumetric variations illuminate our understanding of inner core dynamics and composition. Here we use an extensive number of seismograms recorded by the Hi-net array to construct complete empirical curves of PKPBC-PKPDF differential traveltimes. The nature of these curves implies that significant variations in traveltimes are accumulated during the passage of PKPDF waves through the uppermost inner core and rules out outer core structure effects. Uniform cylindrical anisotropy of a plausible strength in the uppermost inner core can also be ruled out as a cause of the observed traveltime variations because the range of sampled ray angles is too narrow. The configuration and strength of inhomogeneities from a recent tomographic model of the lowermost mantle cannot account for the observed traveltime variations. Therefore, we infer that either variations of P wave isotropic velocity on the scale of about hundred km and less are present in the uppermost inner core or the material may be organized in distinctive anisotropic domains, and both of these features may be superimposed on long-wavelength hemispherical structure. If the former holds true, the absolute magnitude of required P wave velocity perturbations from referent values is 0.60 $\pm$ 0.10{\%} in the quasi-eastern and 1.55 $\pm$ 0.15{\%} in the quasi-western hemisphere (0.85 $\pm$ 0.05{\%} and 1.10 $\pm$ 0.10{\%}, respectively, with the lowermost mantle correction). The existence of these variations is a plausible physical outcome given that vigorous compositional convection in the outer core and variations in heat exchange across the inner core boundary may control the process of solidification.},

Comparison of the asymptotic forms of solutions of the wave equation for displacements and dilatation before the polar crossing with those that apply afterward also show the $\pi$/2 phase shift. Similarly a $\pi$/4 phase advance occurs for waves leaving a point source.Because of the occurrence of the polar phase shift, it is necessary to correct previously published Rayleigh wave and Love wave phase velocities measured by correlation of phases over complete circumferential paths. The corrected Rayleigh wave phase velocity curve is presented here.The polar phase shift is involved in the determination of periods of free oscillation of the earth from surface wave data. Using data from the great Chilean earthquake of May 22, 1960, it is shown that the ratio of the earth's circumference to the wave length at free oscillation periods gives very nearly half integers in accordance with the formula},

We discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses, as well as progress in the resolution of other physical parameters, such as anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound velocity using tomographic approaches. We present the view that future improvements in global seismic tomography require the utilization of the rich information contained in complete broadband seismic waveforms. This is presently within our reach owing to theoretical progress as well as the increase in computational power in recent years.},

	Abstract = {Coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion, up to angular order 3, of velocity anomalies in five shells within the earth's mantle were obtained from an analysis of nearly 700,000 P wave travel time residuals. The results for depths less than 1100 km are unreliable; on the basis of tests and numerical experiments we infer that lateral heterogeneities in this depth interval are dominated by velocity perturbations of lateral dimensions less than 5000 km. Relatively large wavelength features were resolved below 1500-km depth; the average perturbation level increases in the lowermost mantle. The region between 1100 and 1500 km may represent a transition zone with respect to the dimensions of anomalies. We present statistical evidence for a negative correlation between the long wavelength gravity anomalies observed at the surface and those computed from velocity anomalies at depths greater than 1100 km under the assumption of proportionality between velocity and density perturbations. The proportionality coefficient $\Delta$$\upsilon$/$\Delta$$\rho$ has been determined by using two different methods: the values are −4.45 and −6.02 (km/s)/(g/cm3). Only minor changes in the velocity distribution are needed to satisfy the long wavelength gravity field exactly. Possible origins of the correlation are (1) sinking of eclogite-rich material into the lower mantle from regions of lithospheric subduction, (2) chemical plumes of light high-velocity material originating near the core-mantle boundary, (3) temperature differences and perturbations of the core-mantle boundary and the earth's surface associated with mantle-wide convection, or (4) static chemical heterogeneities in a nonconvecting mantle. The first three alternatives, all involving flow in the lower mantle, may be complementary but act on a different time scale. There appears to be a westward or northwestward translation of some anomalies with respect to the pattern obtained for the innermost shell. In particular, the direction of translation of a large negative anomaly under the Pacific is in agreement with the sense of motion of the Pacific plate. We must caution the reader, however, that this is a highly speculative interpretation. If correct, it would favor the convective hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies from PKP(AB--DF) differential travel times at large distances suggest that the central part of the inner core is very anisotropic. These differential times, however, can be affected greatly by strong heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle. Here we examine a unique data set of {\{}PKP{\}} travel times from global digital and analog stations at near antipodal distances, where the effects of both inner core anisotropy and mantle heterogeneity are the greatest. Our results show that the AB--DF residuals for the polar paths are consistently larger than those of the equatorial paths by over 3--4 standard deviations. We also measured {\{}DF{\}} and {\{}AB{\}} absolute times, and found that the {\{}DF{\}} residuals are negatively correlated with the AB--DF residuals while the {\{}AB{\}} residuals have a much weaker correlation with the AB--DF residuals. We compare several mantle models with the data. Our results suggest that the mantle structure can explain part of the residuals of the equatorials paths, but cannot explain the polar path anomalies. These results strongly suggest that most of the AB--DF anomalies for the polar paths are likely from the inner core anisotropy and not from mantle heterogeneity. Assuming a uniform cylindrical anisotropy model, the average inner core anisotropy amplitude is about 2.5{\%}. On the other hand, equatorial paths from events in the west Pacific and recorded at South America show a steep azimuthal change in AB--DF times (about 4 s over a 60$\,^{\circ}$ azimuthal range). The sharp change is well predicted by existing P and S tomographic models: the azimuthal change occurs as the {\{}AB{\}} paths sweep across the great slow anomaly in the central Pacific. The high correlation between the P and S velocities suggests that the central Pacific slow anomaly may be of thermal origin.},

	Abstract = {This note reports on the remarkable focusing of seismic body waves at or near the antipode ($\Delta$ = 180$\,^{\circ}$) of an earthquake's epicentre. The particular seismic velocity structure and sphericity of the Earth cause body-wave phases such as P(diff), PKP, PP, PPP, PcPPKP, SKSSKS, SS, etc. to converge individually at antipodal distances after being diffracted, reflected or refracted at discontinuities. This focusing strongly amplifies each signal up to almost one order of magnitude with respect to the normal phase recorded two or more degrees away. Since the signal/noise ratio is enhanced in the same proportion, seismograms at antipodal distances provide clear and strong arrivals of otherwise weak phases. Antipodal monitoring of seismic waves is suggested as a powerful means of exploring the Earth's interior. The study of these `seismic images' generated at focal points of seismic rays will yield information on the departures from lateral homogeneity and sphericity of the core, as well as stronger constraints on earth models. To interpret the observations correctly, the data must be compared with theoretically generated seismograms. Since the appropriate ray theory equations (see, e.g. Scholte; Gilbert {\&} Helmberger; Richards) are singular at $\Delta$ = 180$\,^{\circ}$, a corrective measure is taken which provides a formal expression for the wave amplitude that remains finite at the antipode, and reproduces the usual expressions at other distances.},

	Abstract = {Earth's solid-iron inner core is elastically anisotropic. Sound waves propagate faster along Earth's spin axis than in the equatorial plane. This anisotropy has previously been explained by a preferred orientation of the iron alloy hexagonal crystals. However, hexagonal iron becomes increasingly isotropic on increasing temperature at pressures of the inner core and is therefore unlikely to cause the anisotropy. An alternative explanation, supported by diamond anvil cell experiments, is that iron adopts a body-centered cubic form in the inner core. We show, by molecular dynamics simulations, that the body-centered cubic iron phase is extremely anisotropic to sound waves despite its high symmetry. Direct simulations of seismic wave propagation reveal an anisotropy of 12{\%}, a value adequate to explain the anisotropy of the inner core.},

This method has the following advantages: it does not necessarily involve the estimation of p by numerical differentiation of the travel times; and it does not involve any interpolation of the travel-time curve between actual observations. Only two assumptions are made: spherical symmetry of the structure (the absence of horizontal inhomogeneities), and the postulation of a lower limit for the velocity in low velocity zones. The function $\tau$(p) is estimated directly from the observed (Ti, Xi) as a singular solution of the Clairaut equation with free term (T(X)).Application of the method is illustrated using data from deep seismic sounding in Turkmenistan.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a method for estimating travel times as a function of epicentral range and hypocentral depth which is faster than ray tracing or direct evaluation of ray integrals yet more compact and general than the interpolation of traditional travel-time tables. In this method, delay or intercept time (tau) as a function of ray parameter and source depth is tabulated. We show that direct manipulation of delay time yields travel time as an explicit function of range eliminating the iteration required to determine the proper ray parameter in ray tracing or the evaluation of ray integrals. Travel-time versus range tables exhibit the same explicit dependence by virtue of having eliminated the common independent variable, ray parameter. However, delay-time branches are monotonic, single-valued, and have fixed ray parameter limits. In contrast, travel-time branches may be nonmonotonic and multi-valued and generally have range limits which vary with source depth. Thus, delay-time tables are simpler to generate and interpolate than are travel-time tables and so result in travel-time estimates which are both more reliable and more precise for a given table size. Further, by retaining the explicit ray parameter dependence and hence a more direct relationship with the ray integrals, the delay-time method offers more flexibility in organizing suites of related phases and in tailoring the algorithm to meet specific computational requirements than does the travel-time table approach. Additionally, we show how the delay-time method can be extended to laterally inhomogeneous media.},

	Abstract = {Hypotheses for the mechanisms of growth of Earth's inner core can be tested from observations of lateral variations of elastic and anelastic properties near the inner core boundary. Differential travel times of PKIKP-PKiKP and the apparent travel time of P waves diffracted around the inner core are consistent with the existence of a stably stratified, globally uniform, region of reduced velocity gradient at the bottom of the outer core. This layer may be a zone of iron enrichment relative to the bulk of the outer core, representing a zone either of crystallization or melting of the inner core. Weak backscattered PKiKP in the equatorial eastern hemisphere can be made consistent with either a hypothesis of freezing or melting. In a melting hypothesis, the eastern hemisphere is texturally older and smoother, with larger crystals or smaller elastic contrasts across grain boundaries providing weaker backscatter to the coda of PKiKP. Additional observations consistent with higher homologous temperature and melting in this region are the existence of a thin low velocity layer in the uppermost inner core inferred from multipathing of PKIKP + PKiKP waves and a bright spot in the amplitude of PKIIKP waves observed at antipodal distances. Alternatively, a freezing hypothesis in the eastern hemisphere is an inner core that is growing radially outward with crystals stretched in the vertical direction. This hypothesis can simultaneously explain weak backscattered PKiKP coda and high attenuation of transmitted PKIKP from the loss of backscattered energy at angles perpendicular to vertically oriented crystals. Strong backscattering observed in the coda of PKiKP sampling the equatorial western hemisphere of the inner core agrees best with a heterogeneity having an isotropic distribution of scale lengths in the uppermost inner core.

	Abstract = {The phase PKIIKP, which is once reflected from the underside of the inner core boundary, was detected at LASA for a large Novaya Zemlya event at an epicentral distance of 63$\,^{\circ}$. The detection was verified by a technique similar to the VESPA process. Clear arrivals for the phases PcP, P2KP, P4KP, and P7KP were also observed. The near-side reflection PKiKP was unfortunately not observed for this event, but it is nevertheless possible to estimate the compressional velocity in the upper half of the inner core by using the differential PKIIKP-PcP travel time. Using this single observation, we estimate the average velocity in the outer half of the inner core to be 11.0 km/sec. This number changes by less than 0.1 km/sec for variations in inner core radius from 1215 to 1230 km, for possible errors in the observed differential times of several seconds, and for reasonable differences in the outer core velocity model (Gilbert et al., 1973, vs. Jordan, 1972).

Band-passed (f{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.02--0.1 Hz) and stacked waveforms coincide with reflectivity synthetic ones for {\{}PREM{\}} very well, whereas those for other global models (iasp91, ak135, and SP6) yield disagreements. A preliminary waveform modeling for the outermost core with {\{}PREM{\}} as initial structure results in a core surface layer with a P-wave velocity of 7.95 km/s at the core top and thickness of 90 km. Based on a 3-D global S-wave velocity model, SmKS phases collected in this study mainly pierce slightly high velocity regions at the base of the mantle, and the predicted differential travel time residuals for S3KS-SKKS are expected to be negative, approximately −{\&}{\#}xa0;0.5 s for the averages. However, positive S3KS-SKKS residuals, of which average is +{\&}{\#}xa0;0.3 s, are predominant in the stacked waveforms. Moreover, a waveform modeling for the D″ structure can result in a 30 km thick layer with a 10{\%} S-wave velocity reduction at the mantle bottom (ULVZ), in which waveform fitness for the part of mainly {\{}S3KS{\}} is improved. On the other hand, the waveform data is not well explained by the lowermost mantle structures with thickness of several hundred kilometers. These suggest that the SmKS data is still affected by the structure of the lowermost several tens kilometers in the mantle that is not sufficiently modeled by a global tomography. Although the thin low S-wave velocity model is not conclusive, the possibility of a low P-wave velocity layer in the outermost core is remained because the waveform fitness for the part of {\{}S4KS{\}} is improved by the combination of the {\{}ULVZ{\}} and a 140 km thick layer with a 0.8{\%} P-wave velocity reduction at the core top.},

We compare the observed signals with synthetic seismograms computed for a spherically symmetric earth model (PREM). A beamforming analysis is performed over the different seismic phases detected at antipodal distances. Direct spatial snapshots of the signals and the beamforming results show that the focusing is well predicted for the first P-wave phases such as PKP or PP. However, converted phases (SKSP, PPS) show a deviation of the energy focusing to the south, likely caused by the Earth's heterogeneity. Focusing of multiple S-wave phases strongly deteriorates and is barely observable.},

	Abstract = {The antipodal region (178$\,^{\circ}$ ≤ $\Delta$ ≤ 180$\,^{\circ}$) of a seismic wave source is investigated in detail and shown to provide a new set of remarkable data to use in the exploration of the earth's interior. Body and surface waves converge individually at antipodal distances after having sampled laterally the totality of the planet. The waves are focused and strongly amplified up to 1 order of magnitude with respect to the normal phase recorded 2$\,^{\circ}$ or more away. The delicate interference patterns thus formed yield information on departures from lateral homogeneity and sphericity of the core and mantle, the structure of the inner core, global dissipation characteristics of the upper mantle, and provide strong constraints on earth models. Seismograms have been synthesized that closely reproduce the phases Pdiff, PKIKP, PKIIKP, PKP(BC), PKP, and PP observed at World-Wide Standard Seismographic Network long-period instruments located within 5$\,^{\circ}$ from the antipode of the New Zealand Inangahua earthquake of May 23, 1968. Preliminary results indicate that the lower mantle and upper core are laterally homogeneous as seen by 15-s waves, but the core-mantle boundary region is probably laterally inhomogeneous. The inner core-outer core boundary appears to be a sharp transition with a P wave velocity jump of the order of 0.8 km/s. The resolution of the long-period data is poor, but the potential richness of the method when better data sets are available strongly motivated the investigation. Suggested future lines of research using antipodal observations include monitoring of inner core phases, study of focal processes of large earthquakes, and the exploration of planetary interiors.},

@article{BOLT1977,
	Abstract = {SUMMARY - The phase PKIIKP, reflected once from the lower surface of the inner core boundary, was most probably recorded by LAS A from the Faultless underground nuclear explosion at 10$\,^{\circ}$.9 angular distance. The array beam detected a P onset, with the correct slowness, within 2 sees of the theoretical travel time. The ground amplitude is 3 + 1 millimicrons at a dominant period of 1.5 sec. By comparison, the PKiKP ground amplitude from Faultless is 75 millimicrons at a dominant period of 1.1 sec. This detection again confirms the sharpness of the inner core boundary and the 1968 core travel times for PKiKP. The additional attenuation of PKIIKP over PKiKP yields, from direct and spectral measurements, Q = 4 5 0 + 1 00 for P waves in the inner core. This value sharpens the earlier estimates of I. Sacks, G. Buchbinder, A. Qamar, and A. Eisenberg and is almost independent of core structure and rigidity. On the assumption of a constant velocity in the inner core, the observed differential PKIIKP minus PKiKP travel time requires an average P velocity of 11.4 + 0.02 km/sec for an inner core radius of 1216 km.},

	Abstract = {A solution of the following problem is presented: given a travel-time curve of a seismic wave, to determine the corresponding velocity distribution. This is a generalization of the Herglotz---Wiechert method to a medium with low-velocity zones.The velocity depends only on depth and is a piecewise double-smooth function with a finite number of waveguides. A complete mathematical description of this solution is presented. In the presence of wave-guides the solution is ambiguous. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a velocity to be a solution are formulated and the set formed by plots of solutions is obtained.The ambiguity arising from waveguides is reduced by a joint analysis of travel-time curves from surface and deep sources. In particular the following theorem is proved: If the travel times for a source between any adjacent waveguides as well as for a surface source are known, then the velocity between these waveguides can be determined uniquely.},

	Abstract = {The SH impulse response of layered medium resulting from the application of a point source shear dislocation is studied by the generalized ray technique. Numerical seismograms of ground displacement in the range 10--100 km are constructed for a number of different crustal models and source descriptions. The results for shallow events show severe wave form modifications at epicentral distances as small as twice the source depth when models contain soft surface layers. A comparison of synthetic seismograms with observations from a central California earthquake of magnitude 4.6 indicates a moment of 2.1×1022 ergs with a faulting duration of 0.5 s. This moment is noticeably smaller than that estimated from the low frequency level of the whole seismogram spectrum assuming the usual homogeneous half-space model. This occurs because the energy arriving with the surface waves and deep crustal reflections boosts the long period portion of the spectrum, giving the impression of an anomalously large moment when calculated in the conventional manner. The close agreement between synthetic results and the actual data both in the time and in the Fourier transform domain suggests that our deterministic approach can be quite useful in understanding the complexity of seismograms recorded in the local field.},

The Mohorovic˘i{\'{c}} discontinuity is treated as a layered transition zone. De Hoop's modification of Cagniard's method is used to obtain the exact transient response which is convolved with the source pulse shape and the instrumental system function to yield theoretical seismograms.When the boundary is an interface or a thin layered transition zone the head wave is a small pure refraction which is followed by a strong reflection. As the transition zone grows in thickness the head wave receives both refracted and reflected energy and becomes the dominant feature. These results compare favorably with observations made in the Bering Sea.This study suggests that the transition zone is thin, probably less than 1 km, in the Northern Aleutian Basin. Southward approaching the Aleutian Islands the transition zone thickens so that no major discontinuity exists between the crust and mantle.},

	Abstract = {The mathematical framework for describing plane waves in elastic and linear anelastic media is presented. Theoretical results suggest that the nature of plane waves in anelastic materials is distinctly different from the nature of plane waves in elastic materials. In elastic media the only type of inhomogeneous plane wave (P or S) that can propagate is one for which planes of constant phase are perpendicular to planes of constant amplitude. However, in anelastic media this is the only type of inhomogeneous wave that cannot propagate. For an inhomogeneous P or S plane wave the particle motion is elliptical, the velocity is less than that of a corresponding homogeneous wave, the maximum attenuation is greater than that of a corresponding homogeneous wave, and the direction of maximum energy flow is not the direction of phase propagation. Expressions for the energy flux, energy densities, dissipated energy, stored energy, and Q−1 are derived from an explicit energy conservation relation, valid for an arbitrary steady state viscoelastic radiation field. Each energy expression is valid for homogeneous or inhomogeneous P or S plane waves in elastic or linear anelastic media.},

	Abstract = {A laboratory analogue of a three-layer linear viscous slab-upper mantle-lower mantle system is established in a silicone putty, honey and crystallized honey tank experiment. The same setup as in the numerical investigation (part 1) is used. We focus on the interaction of the slab with the induced passive mantle flow by widely varying the mantle volume flux boundary conditions. In our numerical experiments the lateral volume flux was set to zero. In interpreting the results relative to the real Earth, the base of the box is taken as the bottom of the mantle convection system, while the lateral boundaries may be associated with the presence of other nearby slabs. Dynamic force equilibrium, assessed on the basis of an analytical review of forces, is described for four different phases: (1) the subduction initiation instability, (2) the accelerating dynamic free fall phase of the slab, (3) the dynamic interaction with the 660-km discontinuity, and (4) a final phase of steady state trench retreat. Phase 3 is an important feature not observed in the numerical experiments. This highly dynamic phase of interrupted trench retreat can therefore be attributed to boundary conditions on mantle volume flux. On the basis of integration constants of force equilibrium in phases 2 and 4 we identify two different classes of volume flux: one in which the lateral boundary can be considered open and the other class where it is ``closed.'' Closed boundary condition cases are obtained if any of the lateral box boundaries are 600 km away from the slab. Assuming a one-to-one relation between trench retreat and back arc spreading, enigmatic observations of episodic opening of back arc basins can be explained by our experimental observations.},

	Abstract = {New high-resolution P- and S-wave tomography of the United States upper mantle from the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains reveals strong multi-scale heterogeneity closely correlated with tectonic and magmatic activity. We invert teleseismic travel-time residuals from the EarthScope Transportable Array and more than 1700 additional temporary and permanent stations for 3-D velocity perturbations to a depth of 1000 km. The inversion uses recent advances in western U.S. crust models to better isolate the mantle component of travel-time residuals, and frequency-dependent 3-D sensitivity kernels to map travel-time residuals, measured in multiple frequency bands, into velocity structure. In addition to separate VP and VS models, we jointly invert the two datasets for VP/VS perturbations by imposing a smoothness constraint on the $\delta$lnVS/$\delta$lnVP field. The joint inversion helps us identify regions where partial melt is probable. The amplitude of VP, VS, and VP/VS variations is greatest in the upper 200 km of the mantle and the form of velocity anomalies suggests a provincially heterogeneous lithosphere and the occurrence of widespread small-scale convection. Partially molten mantle is inferred beneath Yellowstone and the eastern Snake River Plain (SRP), the Salton Trough, and the Clear Lake volcanic field. The inferred depth extent of partial melt is consistent with a generally hydrated upper mantle and elevated temperatures beneath the eastern SRP and Yellowstone. Despite continuous subduction since the Cretaceous, the distribution of sub-lithospheric high-velocity anomalies is dissected (similar to other recent studies). Based on our new tomography models, western U.S. geologic history, and plate--tectonic reconstructions, we infer patchy and incomplete removal of the flat-subducting Laramide slab and slab tearing associated with Eocene accretion in the northwestern U.S.},

One often favored explanation for flat slabs is the subduction of buoyant features on the oceanic plate in the form of an aseismic-ridge or oceanic plateau. We show through plate tectonic reconstructions of the Marquesas, Tuamotu, and Austral plateau, assuming that features on the conjugate plate can be used as proxies for subducted bathymetric anomalies, that there is very little correlation between the subduction of such anomalies and historic zones of flat subduction in South America. It is apparent that subduction of a bathymetric anomaly need not lead to a flat slab and not all flat slabs are associated with the subduction of a bathymetric anomaly.},

	Abstract = {We present lithospheric-scale analog models, investigating how the absolute plates' motion and subduction of buoyant oceanic plateaus can affect both the kinematics and the geometry of subduction, possibly resulting in the appearance of flat slab segments, and how it changes the overriding plate tectonic regime. Experiments suggest that flat subductions only occur if a large amount of a buoyant slab segment is forced into subduction by kinematic boundary conditions, part of the buoyant plateau being incorporated in the steep part of the slab to balance the negative buoyancy of the dense oceanic slab. Slab flattening is a long-term process (∼10 Ma), which requires the subduction of hundreds of kilometers of buoyant plateau. The overriding plate shortening rate increases if the oceanic plateau is large enough to decrease the slab pull effect. Slab flattening increases the interplate friction force and results in migration of the shortening zone within the interior of the overriding plate. The increase of the overriding plate topography close to the trench results from (1) the buoyancy of the plate subducting at trench and (2) the overriding plate shortening. Experiments are compared to the South American active margin, where two major horizontal slab segments had formed since the Pliocene. Along the South American subduction zone, flat slab segments below Peru and central Chile/NW Argentina appeared at ∼7 Ma following the beginning of buoyant slab segments' subduction. In northern Ecuador and northern Chile, the process of slab flattening resulting from the Carnegie and Iquique ridges' subductions, respectively, seems to be active but not completed. The formation of flat slab segments below South America from the Pliocene may explain the deceleration of the Nazca plate trenchward velocity.},

@article{Schmid2002,
	Abstract = {After more than 100 million years of subduction, only small parts of the Farallon plate are still subducting below western North America today. Due to the relatively young age of the most recently subducted parts of the Farallon plate and their high rates of subduction, the subducted lithosphere might be expected to have mostly thermally equilibrated with the surrounding North American mantle. However, images from seismic tomography show positive seismic velocity anomalies, which have been attributed to this subduction, in both the upper and lower mantle beneath North America. We use a three-dimensional kinematic thermal model based on the Cenozoic plate tectonic history to quantify the thermal structure of the subducted Farallon plate in the upper mantle and determine which part of the plate is imaged by seismic tomography. We find that the subducted Farallon lithosphere is not yet thermally equilibrated and that its thermal signature for each time of subduction is found to be presently detectable as positive seismic velocity anomalies by tomography. However, the spatially integrated positive seismic velocity anomalies in tomography exceed the values obtained from the thermal model for a rigid, continuous slab by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0. We conclude that Farallon fragments that subducted since 50 to 60 Ma are still residing in the upper mantle and must be heavily deformed. The deformation of the slab in the transition zone is probably caused by the same mechanisms that were responsible for flat subduction around 60 Ma.},

	Abstract = {Seismic interferometry involves the crosscorrelation of re- sponses at different receivers to obtain the Green's function be- tween these receivers. For the simple situation of an impulsive plane wave propagating along the x-axis, the crosscorrelation of the responses at two receivers along the x-axis gives the Green's function of the direct wave between these receivers. When the source function of the plane wave is a transient ?as in exploration seismology? or a noise signal ?as in passive seismology?, then the crosscorrelation gives the Green's function, convolved with the autocorrelation of the source function. Direct-wave interferome- try also holds for 2D and 3D situations, assuming the receivers are surrounded by a uniform distribution of sources. In this case, the main contributions to the retrieved direct wave between the receivers come from sources in Fresnel zones around stationary points. The main application of direct-wave interferometry is the retrieval of seismic surface-wave responses from ambient noise and the subsequent tomographic determination of the surface- wavevelocity distribution of the subsurface. Seismic interferom- etry is not restricted to retrieving direct waves between receivers. In a classic paper, Claerbout shows that the autocorrelation of the transmission response of a layered medium gives the plane-wave reflection response of that medium.This is essentially1Dreflect- ed-wave interferometry. Similarly, the crosscorrelation of the transmission responses, observed at two receivers, of an arbitrary inhomogeneous medium gives the 3D reflection response of that medium.One of the main applications of reflected-wave interfer- ometry is retrieving the seismic reflection response from ambient noise and imaging of the reflectors in the subsurface.Acommon aspect of direct- and reflected-wave interferometry is that virtual sources are created at positions where there are only receivers without requiring knowledge of the subsurface medium parame- ters or of the positions of the actual sources.},

	Abstract = {In the 1990s, the method of time-reversed acoustics was developed. This method exploits the fact that the acoustic wave equation for a lossless medium is invariant for time reversal. When ultrasonic responses recorded by piezoelectric transducers are reversed in time and fed simultaneously as source signals to the transducers, they focus at the position of the original source, even when the medium is very complex. In seismic interferometry the time-reversed responses are not physically sent into the earth, but they are convolved with other measured responses. The effect is essentially the same: The time-reversed signals focus and create a virtual source which radiates waves into the medium that are subsequently recorded by receivers. A mathematical derivation, based on reciprocity theory, formalizes this principle: The cross- correlation of responses at two receivers, integrated over different sources, gives the Green's function emitted by a virtual source at the position of one of the receivers and observed by the other receiver. This Green's function representation for seismic interferometry is based on the assumption that the medium is lossless and nonmoving. Recent developments, circumventing these assumptions, include interferometric representations for attenuating and/or moving media, as well as unified representations for waves and diffusion phenomena, bending waves, quantum mechanical scattering, potential fields, elastodynamic, electromagnetic, poroelastic, and electroseismic waves. Significant improvements in the quality of the retrieved Green's functions have been obtained with interferometry by deconvolution. A trace-by-trace deconvolution process compensates for complex source functions and the attenuation of the medium. Interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution also compensates for the effects of one-sided and/or irregular illumination.},

	Abstract = {Improved methods for single-and multiple-event hypocenter determinations are developed and applied to the problem of locating earthquake clusters in the South-Central Pacific Ocean. Bayesian statistical methods are used to incorporate a priori information about arrival-time variance into the derivation of hypocenter confidence ellipsoids, permitting a more realistic calculation of critical parameters in the case where the number of stations is small. The diagonal elements of certain projection operators, called ``data importances'' by Minster et al. (1974), are used to evaluate network balance. The hypocentroid of an event cluster is defined to be the average location of events within the cluster, and the deviations of individual hypocenters from the hypocentroid are called cluster vectors. The problem of estimating the cluster vectors can be decoupled from the problem of estimating the hypocentroid by a simple but fundamental mathematical result, here termed the hypocentroidal decomposition theorem. The algorithm based on this analysis appears to have many advantages over other published methods for multiple-event location, both in its efficient use of available information and its computational speed. The application of this method to three clusters of shallow intraplate seismicity in the South-Central Pacific, designated Regions A, B, and C, demonstrates that the seismicity within each cluster is very localized; the rms lengths of the cluster vectors for each group of epicenters are estimated to be only 9, 6, and 12 km, respectively.

	Abstract = {We detect previously unreported 1 Hz scattered waves at epicentral distances between 30$\,^{\circ}$ and 50$\,^{\circ}$ and at times between 2300 and 2450 s after the earthquake origin. These waves likely result from off-azimuth scattering of PKPbc to PKPbc in the upper mantle and crust and provide a new tool for mapping variations in fine-scale (10 km) mantle heterogeneity. Array beams from the Large Aperture Seismic Array (LASA) clearly image the scattered energy gradually emerging from the noise and reaching its peak amplitude about 80 s later, and returning to the noise level after 150 s. Stacks of transverse versus radial slowness ($\rho$t, $\rho$r) show two peaks at about (2, -2) and (-2,-2) s/$\,^{\circ}$, indicating the waves arrive along the major arc path (180$\,^{\circ}$ to 360$\,^{\circ}$) and significantly off azimuth. We propose a mantle and surface PKPbc to PKPbc scattering mechanism for these observations because (1) it agrees with the initiation time and distinctive slowness signature of the scattered waves and (2) it follows a scattering path analogous to previously observed deep-mantle PK*KP scattering (Chang and Cleary, 1981). The observed upper-mantle scattered waves and PK*KP waves fit into a broader set of scattered waves that we call P′*d*P′, which can scatter from any depth, d, in the mantle.},

	Abstract = {Examining seismogram envelopes of regional earthquakes in Central Asia with focal depths deeper than 150 km in 1s--20s periods for a wide lapse time range up to 2000s, we found an offset in each coda envelope before and after the ScS arrival at 10s and 15s periods. The ScS wave has its own tail, that is, scattered waves of ScS waves sometimes dominate over the original coda waves composed of scattered S waves and scattered surface waves. For 1s, 2s and 4s periods, such an offset is not clear. However, there is a change of coda decay gradient associated with the ScS arrival. In a layered velocity and attenuation structure according to the PREM, scattering process of S-waves can be simulated by using the Monte Carlo method based on the radiative transfer theory for isotropic scattering process. Comparing numerical simulation for a two-layered scattering model with observed envelopes, we estimated the total scattering coefficients as 1.129 × 10−3 km−1 and 6.230 × 10−4 km−1 at 4s, and 4.510 × 10−4 km−1 and 2.710 × 10−4 km−1 at 10s, for the lithosphere and upper mantle and for the lower mantle, respectively.

	Abstract = {We have developed an efficient method to determine high-resolution hypocenter locations over large distances. The location method incorporates ordinary absolute travel-time measurements and/or cross-correlation P- and S-wave differential travel-time measurements. Residuals between observed and theoretical travel-time differences (or double-differences) are minimized for pairs of earthquakes at each station while linking together all observed event-station pairs. A least-squares solution is found by iteratively adjusting the vector difference between hypocentral pairs. The double-difference algorithm minimizes errors due to unmodeled velocity structure without the use of station corrections. Because catalog and cross-correlation data are combined into one system of equations, interevent distances within multiplets are determined to the accuracy of the cross-correlation data, while the relative locations between multiplets and uncorrelated events are simultaneously determined to the accuracy of the absolute travel-time data. Statistical resampling methods are used to estimate data accuracy and location errors. Uncertainties in double-difference locations are improved by more than an order of magnitude compared to catalog locations. The algorithm is tested, and its performance is demonstrated on two clusters of earthquakes located on the northern Hayward fault, California. There it collapses the diffuse catalog locations into sharp images of seismicity and reveals horizontal lineations of hypocenters that define the narrow regions on the fault where stress is released by brittle failure.},

	Abstract = {We relocate 297,400 events recorded by the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) between 1975 and 1998 using spatially varying station terms to improve relative location accuracy. Our method uses existing SCSN P and S picks, a smooth one-dimensional velocity model, and an iterative grid search approach based on the L1 norm. We apply empirical corrections for three-dimensional structure by computing station timing corrections that continuously vary as a function of source position. Station terms for each event are obtained by smoothing the residuals from nearby events using a natural neighbor (Delaunay) tessellation of the seismicity and then iterating until a stable set of locations and station terms is achieved. Our approach achieves relative location accuracy comparable locally to master event methods but can be applied uniformly over large regions. Median estimated standard errors for our final locations are 328 m in horizontal position and 741 m in depth. Our locations exhibit much less scatter, particularly in depth, than those of the SCSN catalog and a greater tendency to align into linear and planar features suggestive of fault structures. Our results appear comparable to, and in some cases better than, previous SCSN relocation studies using joint-hypocenter-velocity inversion techniques. Plots of daytime versus nighttime events permit discrimination between clusters of natural and artificial seismicity. We observe no simple relationship between the maximum depth of seismicity and surface geology.},

@article{Shearer2004,
	Abstract = {At high frequencies (∼1 Hz), much of the seismic energy arriving at teleseismic distances is not found in the main phases (e.g. P, PP, S, etc.) but is contained in the extended coda that follows these arrivals. This coda results from scattering off small-scale velocity and density perturbations within the crust and mantle and contains valuable information regarding the depth dependence and strength of this heterogeneity as well as the relative importance of intrinsic versus scattering attenuation. Most analyses of seismic coda to date have concentrated on S-wave coda generated from lithospheric scattering for events recorded at local and regional distances. Here, we examine the globally averaged vertical-component, 1-Hz wavefield ({\textgreater}10$\,^{\circ}$ range) for earthquakes recorded in the IRIS FARM archive from 1990 to 1999. We apply an envelope-function stacking technique to image the average time--distance behavior of the wavefield for both shallow (≤50 km) and deep (≥500 km) earthquakes. Unlike regional records, our images are dominated by P and P coda owing to the large effect of attenuation on PP and S at high frequencies. Modelling our results is complicated by the need to include a variety of ray paths, the likely contributions of multiple scattering and the possible importance of P-to-S and S-to-P scattering. We adopt a stochastic, particle-based approach in which millions of seismic phonons are randomly sprayed from the source and tracked through the Earth. Each phonon represents an energy packet that travels along the appropriate ray path until it is affected by a discontinuity or a scatterer. Discontinuities are modelled by treating the energy normalized reflection and transmission coefficients as probabilities. Scattering probabilities and scattering angles are computed in a similar fashion, assuming random velocity and density perturbations characterized by an exponential autocorrelation function. Intrinsic attenuation is included by reducing the energy contained in each particle as an appropriate function of traveltime. We find that most scattering occurs in the lithosphere and upper mantle, as previous results have indicated, but that some lower-mantle scattering is likely also required. A model with 3 to 4 per cent rms velocity heterogeneity at 4-km scale length in the upper mantle and 0.5 per cent rms velocity heterogeneity at 8-km scale length in the lower mantle (with intrinsic attenuation of Q$\alpha$= 450 above 200 km depth and Q$\alpha$= 2500 below 200 km) provides a reasonable fit to both the shallow- and deep-earthquake observations, although many trade-offs exist between the scale length, depth extent and strength of the heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {We study multiple scattering of elastic waves with a Monte Carlo method. We take into account the mode conversions and the polarization of the S waves. Some important physical parameters relevant to the description of the polarization are recalled, such as the definition and properties of the elastic Stokes vector. We briefly derive the scattering and Mueller matrices, as well as the differential and total scattering cross sections for one spherical inclusion embedded in a homogeneous matrix. The results of the single-scattering problem are used as a building block for multiple scattering. A Monte Carlo method to simulate the propagation of full elastic waves is presented. We pay a special attention to the convergence toward the diffusive regime which exhibits the equilibration of the P and S energy densities. Our simulations show the shear energy to become very rapidly dominant in the coda and the S to P energy density ratio to tend to 10.4 for a Poisson solid, as predicted by the equipartition theorem. However, the typical timescale and length scale to reach equipartition heavily depend on the scattering parameter kpa, where kp is the P wave number and a is the sphere radius. For Rayleigh scattering (kpa ≪ 1) we find a smooth evolution of energy density with time and a slow convergence toward the equilibration, mainly because of the large difference between the P and S scattering mean free paths in this case. On the other hand, for Rayleigh-Gans scattering (kpa ∼ 1.2, 1.6) a peak of energy associated with the forward scattered waves is observed, followed by a slow decay according to the diffusion approximation. We find that after only a few mean free times, equipartition is reached in spite of the strong anisotropy of the scattering in this regime. As the scattering parameter kpa increases, we find that equipartition is again delayed because the transport mean free paths become quite large. We find that a large source-station distance favors a rapid equilibration. This effect is seen to be very pronounced for Rayleigh scatterers. When a source of P waves is considered, the equipartition time can be twice as long as compared with a shear source. The time evolution of the Ep/Es ratio could be used as a marker for the different scattering mechanisms.},

To determine an accurate Moho depth we have reduced the trade-off between crustal velocities and discontinuity depth using a new grid search method, which is an extension of recently published methods to determine crustal thickness. In this method the best fitting synthetic receiver function, containing both the direct conversion and the reverberated phases, is identified on a model grid of varying Moho depth and varying Poisson's ratio. The values we found for Moho depth range from around 20 km for intra-oceanic islands and extended continental margins to near 45 km in regions where the Eurasian and African continents have collided. More detailed waveform modelling shows that all receiver functions can be well fit using a 2- or 3-layer model containing a sedimentary layer and/or a mid-crustal discontinuity. On comparing our results with Moho maps inferred from interpolated reflection and refraction data, we find that for some regions the agreement between our receiver function analysis and existing Moho maps is very good, while for other regions our observations deviate from the interpolated map values and extend beyond the geographic bounds of these maps.},

The variation in crustal thickness is substantially greater than that required for local isostasy, unless lower crustal densities are {\textgreater}3110 kg/m3. In the upper mantle, Ps phases corresponding to a discontinuity at depths of 270--280 km were clearly observed beneath the eastern half of the array.

An adapted hybrid global waveform inversion method was applied to the receiver functions to extract structural information beneath each of the stations. The derived S-velocity structure provides for the first time, a basin-scale seismic image of detailed sedimentary stratification. The sedimentary cover of the basin is about 2--12 km thick, consisting of Cenozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleozoic strata from top to bottom. The structural features presented in the S-velocity image coincide quite well with the depression--uplift type of tectonic system in the Bohai Bay Basin. The reconstructed morphology of the sedimentary layers provides seismological evidence for the two-stage evolution of the intracontinental basin that were caused by an intensive tectonic regime transition in late Mesozoic immediately following the lithospheric reforming of the Eastern China continent.},

	Abstract = {Indications of lower mantle discontinuities have been debated for decades, but still little is known about their properties, and their origins are enigmatic. In our study broad-band recordings of deep events are examined for the presence of signals from the lower-mantle discontinuities with a novel technique. We deconvolve vertical component of the P-wave coda in the period range around 10s by the S waveform and stack many deconvolved traces with moveout time corrections. In synthetic seismograms for an earth model without lower mantle discontinuities, the strongest signal thus detected in the time window of interest is often s`410'P phase (generated as S and reflected as P from the `410km' discontinuity above the source). In actual seismograms there are other phases that can be interpreted as converted from S to P at discontinuities in the lower mantle beneath the seismic source. We summarize the results of processing the seismograms (1) of deep events in Sunda arc at seismograph stations in east Asia, (2) deep Kermadec--Fiji--Tonga events at the J-array and FREESIA networks in Japan and stations in east Asia, and (3) deep events in the northwest Pacific region (Mariana, Izu-Bonin and the Japan arc) recorded at stations in north America. In our data there are indications of discontinuities near 860--880, 1010--1120, 1170--1250 and 1670--1800km depths. The clearest signals are obtained from the discontinuity at a depth of 1200km. We argue that the `900', `1200' and `1700km' discontinuities are global, but laterally variable in both depth and strength. Seismic stratification of the lower mantle may have bearings on the patterns of subduction, as revealed by tomographic models.},

Conversely, to the south beneath the Tethyan Himalaya, no low-velocity zone was observed. The presence of the midcrustal low-velocity zone in the north implies that a partially molten layer is in the middle crust beneath the northern Yadong-Gulu rift and possibly much of southern Tibet.},

	Abstract = {Several years of broad-band teleseismic data from the GRSN stations have been analysed for crustal structure using P-to-S converted waves at the crustal discontinuities. An inversion technique was developed which applies the Thomson-Haskell formalism for plane waves without slowness integration. The main phases observed are Moho conversions, their multiples in the crust, and conversions at the base of the sediments. The crustal thickness derived from these data is in good agreement with results from other studies. For the Gr{\"{a}}fenberg stations, we have made a more detailed comparison of our model with a previously published model obtained from refraction seismic experiments. The refraction seismic model contains boundaries with strong velocity contrasts and a significant low-velocity zone, resulting in teleseismic waveforms that are too complicated as compared to the observed simple waveforms. The comparison suggests that a significant low-velocity zone is not required and that internal crustal boundaries are rather smooth.},

This method can not only evaluate the velocity distribution below the receiver station from the waveform inversion, but also search the interfaces of the crust and the upper mantle after the superimposition of the receiver function traces. The receiver functions methods are most sensitive to the shear velocity structure near the station, gross lateral variations in structure may be obtained by examining the variation in vertical velocity distribution azimuthally around the station. The receiver function method is simple and easy to implement. Besides, it has the high resolution power with the high-density deployment of the broadband flowing seismic array. This paper overviews the evolvement of the receiver function over the recent 20 years and presents some results using this method, and in the end we argues about some tendency in the study of the method.},

The robustness and reliability of the resultant crustal image were noticeably improved by achieving imaging consistency between common conversion point stacking and waveform inversion of the receiver functions. Our imaging result revealed substantial lateral heterogeneities in the crust of the study region, as displayed by the undulating intra-crustal interfaces, highly varying upper-, middle-, and lower crust thicknesses, and interlayers of low and high velocities. The crustal structure of the YSB is characterized by significant structural variations together with a sharp Moho, a thin-to-normal crust and a lower crust with lower velocity and normal thickness. It differs markedly from the Bohai Bay basin and the Taihang Mountains within the interior of the NCC. The distinct features and structural complexity of the YSB might be attributed to the complex tectonic history of the region, especially the multiple phases of contraction and possible occurrence of crustal delamination, which is in large contrast to other subregions of the NCC where tectonic extension likely dominated the crustal deformation since the late Mesozoic.},

Results based on a modified receiver function waveform analysis of Moho conversions and crustal reverberation phases show that the crust beneath the array is thin (35.4 km) with an average Poisson's ratio of 0.254. The minimum S-wave velocity contrast across the Moho is 17.3{\%} while the contrast in density is 15.4{\%}. The density contrast across the Moho is particularly diagnostic. For an assumed uppermost mantle density beneath Kimberley of 3.3 gm/cc as determined from mantle xenoliths, the density of the lowermost crust is 2.86 gm/cc, indicating rocks of felsic to intermediate composition. Analysis of waveform broadening of the crustal reverberation phases relative to that of the direct P-wave shows the thickness of the Moho transition zone to be less than 0.5 km and the maximum variation in crustal thickness over the region of the array to be less than 1 km. The flat and almost perfectly sharp Moho, together with the absence of a mafic lower crust, suggests large-scale crustal reworking in the period between crustal formation and the time of cratonic stabilization.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated crustal thickness and composition across the southeastern Caribbean plate boundary with the receiver function technique. We used teleseismic data recorded by a temporary broadband array deployed under the BOLIVAR project and the permanent national seismic network of Venezuela. We used the primary P-to-S conversion and crustal reverberations to estimate crustal thickness and average crustal VP/VS ratio over the region. We observe large variations in crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio. Estimated Moho depth ranges from ∼16 km beneath the southeastern Caribbean Sea to ∼52 km beneath northeastern Venezuela and the Venezuelan Andes. There is a good correlation between crustal structure and tectonic terranes. Data from the Precambrian Guayana Shield suggest that the underlying crustal structure is relatively uniform with a moderate thickness (∼37 km) and an intermediate composition. A thick crust is found below the foreland basins. The two mountain systems in northern Venezuela, the Serrania del Interior and the Serrania del Falcon, have a thin crust with arc composition and are likely dynamically supported by elastic rebound or underthrusting of the oceanic plateau that characterizes the southern Caribbean. On the other hand, the Venezuelan Andes and Perija Range on the western side of the country are probably isostatically balanced by thick crustal roots.},

	Abstract = {In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of receiver function data, it is typical to stack receiver functions calculated from events at similar distances and back azimuths. We have adapted the velocity spectrum stacking (VSS) technique, used extensively in reflection seismology, to the receiver function method in order to stack data with different ray parameters, thereby improving further the signal-to-noise ratio. Perhaps more importantly, by producing the velocity spectrum stacks we take advantage of the differences in the shapes of the moveout curves of converted phases and reverberations to identify and separate the various phases and to infer velocity structure. By comparison of velocity spectrum stacks produced from the observed data at the IRIS/IDA broad-band station at Obninsk, Russia (OBN) with those produced from PREM synthetics we have identified Ps phases from the 400 and 670 km discontinuities. The P-to-S (Ps) converted phase from the 400 km discontinuity observed at OBN is much larger, compared with that of the 670 km discontinuity, than is predicted by PREM. This suggests a higher velocity contrast at 400 km than in PREM. By adapting a bootstrap method to assess the depth and velocity estimates determined by VSS, we find that the Ps phase from the 670 km discontinuity is best imaged with higher than PREM upper mantle P and S velocities and at a depth of 663 $\pm$ 3 km. We find no evidence of a 220 km discontinuity beneath OBN in these data.},

	Abstract = {The site structure beneath the five broadband stations of the Regional Seismic Test Network (RSTN) has been determined utilizing teleseismic P waveforms. Our teleseismic waveform modeling technique involves inverting the radial component of stacked source-equalized receiver functions in the time domain to estimate the vertical shear velocity structure at the site. The receiver functions at RSNY (Adirondacks, New York), RSON (Red Lake, Ontario), and RSNT (Yellowknife, Northwest Territory) are quite simple compared to previously published RSCP (Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee) data, largely due to the absence of sedimentary surface rocks at these sites. At RSNY, a high-velocity layer at mid-crustal depths (18 to 26 km) in our southeast backazimuth results correlates in depth with a zone of high-amplitude reflections found on COCORP profiles 60 km south of RSNY. A gradational crust-mantle boundary is observed at RSCP and RSNY. The RSON and RSNT sites are characterized by simple crusts with fairly abrupt crust-mantle boundaries. The crust beneath RSON appears to have a clear division between the upper and lower crust at about 18 km depth while this boundary is not well-developed at RSNT. Pronounced azimuthal variations in crustal structure at RSSD (Black Hills, South Dakota) prohibit the determination of velocity using a layered earth model. The crustal thicknesses at each of these sites are: RSCP, 40 to 50 km; RSSD, 47 to 50 km; RSNY, 45 to 50 km; RSNT, 38 km; and RSON, 42 km.},

Waveforms of deep regional events in the downgoing Nazca slab and teleseismic earthquakes were processed to isolate the P-to-S converted phases from the Moho in order to compute the crustal thickness. We found crustal-thickness variations of nearly 40 km across the Andes. Maximum crustal thicknesses of 70--74 km under the Western Cordillera and the Eastern Cordillera thin to 32--38 km 200 km east of the Andes in the Chaco Plain. The central Altiplano at 20$\,^{\circ}$S has crustal thicknesses of 60 to 65 km. The crust also appears to thicken from north (16$\,^{\circ}$S, 55--60 km) to south (20$\,^{\circ}$S, 70--74 km) along the Eastern Cordillera. The Subandean zone crust has intermediate thicknesses of 43 to 47 km. Crustal-thickness predictions for the Andes based on Airy-type isostatic behavior show remarkable overall correlation with observed crustal thickness in the regions of high elevation. In contrast, at the boundary between the Eastern Cordillera and the Subandean zone and in the Chaco Plain, the crust is thinner than predicted, suggesting that the crust in these regions is supported in part by the flexural rigidity of a strong lithosphere. With additional constraints, we conclude that the observation of Airy-type isostasy is consistent with thickening associated with compressional shortening of a weak lithosphere squeezed between the stronger lithosphere of the subducting Nazca plate and the cratonic lithosphere of the Brazilian craton.},

To speed up the waveform inversions, we implement Randall's (1989) efficient algorithms for calculating differential seismograms and include a smoothness constraint on all the resulting velocity models utilizing the ``jumping'' inversion technique of Shaw and Orcutt (1985). We present the results of more than 235 waveform inversions for one-dimensional velocity structures that indicate that the primary sensitivity of a receiver function is to high wavenumber velocity changes, and a depth-velocity product, not simply velocity. The range of slownesses in a typical receiver function study does not appear to be broad enough to remove the depth-velocity ambiguity; the inclusion of a priori information is necessary. We also present inversion results for station RSCP, located in the Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee. Our results are similar to those from a previous study by Owens et al. (1984) and demonstrate the uncertainties in the resulting velocity estimate more clearly.},

	Abstract = {Long-period P waves from distant earthquakes have been analyzed from seismograms recorded at Albuquerque and Bermuda in the light of Haskel's theory of the spectral response of a layered crust. By using the ratio of the vertical spectrum to the horizontal component spectrum, we obtain a function which depends on structure beneath the station. Because of the poorly understood nature of the signal which follows the first P wave motion, the methods of power spectrum analysis are applied and a lag window selected to discriminate against long time correlations within the signal. Corrections for the differing responses of the three components are made by using the power spectral matrix of calibration signals. A range of crustal models has been found which agrees with the data. We are restricted primarily in choosing models for the lower half of the crust; variations of structure in the upper half do not noticeably affect the theoretical curves in the period range considered (0.02 to 0.20 cps). At Albuquerque the crust is about 40 km thick and the lower crust has velocities in the range 6.6 to 7.0 km/sec. The Mohorovicic (M) discontinuity under Bermuda is 12 km below sea level, and the structure appears to be a normal oceanic crust depressed elastically by the weight of the volcanics which compose the island.},

	Abstract = {By comparing records of the radial component of motion of teleseismic P waves to records of the vertical component, it is possible to identify S phases within the P wave form. These phases are generated by the mechanism of P to S conversion at discontinuities in velocity under the receiving station. Similar phases of the S to P converted type appear as precursors to the direct SV arrival. Models for the crustal structure can be tested by generating synthetic seismograms for both components of motion of both the P and SV waves and comparing with the data. The technique has been used to model the crustal structure at WWSSN stations CAR and COR. It has also been used to check a recently proposed model for the crustal structure in eastern Canada which contains a large low-shear-velocity zone at the base of the crust. This study indicates that the crustal structure in eastern Canada is highly non-uniform with perhaps few features common to the whole region. Finally, the technique is used to identify several stations in the WWSSN which appear to be located on highly anomalous structure.},

	Abstract = {A geometrical ray method is developed for wave calculations involving three-dimensional planar dipping interfaces. Justification for the method is based on analogy with first-motion approximations derived from generalized ray theory where frequency dependence in the reflection-transmission coefficients is related to changes in the complex ray parameter. The method is applied to finding the teleseismic response of an arbitrarily oriented dislocation source in dipping layered media and for receiver calculations which assume an impinging P or S wave beneath a stack of dipping layers. Source results indicate that wave forms from fast azimuthally varying sources, such as strike-slip faults, are significantly distorted from the plane layered case for simple structures. A simple dipping Moho for dips up to 10$\,^{\circ}$ does not significantly distort vertical and radial P waves for the receiver response. However, due to azimuth anomalies introduced by interface dip a significant tangential P component is produced. In addition, the S-wave response becomes a function of source mechanism due to the need for specifying the incident polarization angle. Polarization studies are suggested for finding dipping structure.},

	Abstract = {This is the first paper in a three-part series that examines formal inversion of the teleseismic P wave coda for discontinuous variations in elastic properties beneath dense, three-component, seismic arrays. In this paper, we develop the theoretical framework for a migration method that draws upon the tenets of inverse scattering theory and is amenable to practical implementation. The forward problem is formulated for two-dimensional (2-D) heterogeneity in observance of formal sampling requirements and currently accessible instrumentation. A ray theoretic Green's function, corresponding to a line source with axial component of forcing, is employed within the 2-D Born approximation to accommodate planar, incident wave fields at arbitrary back azimuths. Both the forward scattered response generated by the upgoing incident wave field and the backscattered response created by its reflection at the free surface are included within the formulation. In accordance with the high-frequency and single-scattering approximations employed in the forward problem the inverse problem is cast as a generalized Radon transform. The resulting back projection operator is well suited to the teleseismic context in several respects. It is tolerant of irregularities in array geometry and source distribution and allows a full complement of global seismicity to be utilized through its accommodation of oblique incidence. By permitting both independent and simultaneous treatment of different scattering modes (reflections, transmissions, conversions) the inversion formula facilitates a direct appraisal of individual mode contributions to the recovery of structure. In particular, it becomes evident that incorporation of backscattered modes leads to (1) a better localization of structure than possible using forward scattered energy and (2) the imposition of complementary constraints on elastic properties.},

A stack of all radial receiver functions resolves the 410 and 660 km discontinuities at average depths of 419 and 677 km, respectively. Imaging of lateral variations in mantle discontinuity structure is accomplished by geographically binning the Pds conversion points and then stacking the receiver functions in each bin to form spatial images, analogous to common depth point stacking. Corrections for lateral velocity heterogeneity are calculated using the local S wave tomographic model of Lee and Grand [1996] and a constant ∂lnVs/∂lnVP scaling of 1.3. This scaling value is determined from the relative scaling between teleseismic P and S wave travel time residuals measured from the Rocky Mountain Front deployment. Mantle discontinuity images using 150 km square bins show 20 km of 410 km discontinuity topography, 30 km of 660 km discontinuity topography, and up to 40 km of transition zone thickness variation. Features of the discontinuity structure include a 20 km depression of the 660 km discontinuity beneath western Colorado and a gradual 10 km dip of the 410 km discontinuity beneath the High Plains. The thickening of the transition zone beneath southwest Colorado is consistent with the presence of the subducted Farallon slab in this region as imaged by Van der Lee and Nolet [1997]. In general, our results show that the transition zone discontinuity structure is more complex than that predicted by the simple model of olivine phase boundaries modulated by vertically coherent thermal anomalies.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of a deployment of broadband sensors along a 500-km-long line crossing the Yellowstone hotspot track (YHT) has provided 423 in-plane receiver functions with which to image lateral variations in mantle discontinuity structure. Imaging is accomplished by performing the converted wave equivalent of a common midpoint stack, which significantly improves resolution of mantle discontinuity structure with respect to single-station stacks. Timing corrections are calculated from locally derived tomographic P and S wave velocity images and applied to the Pds (where d is the depth of the conversion) ray set in order to isolate true discontinuity topography. Using the one-dimensional TNA velocity model and a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.82 to map our Pds times to depth, the average depths of the 410- and 660-km discontinuities are 423 and 664 km, respectively, giving an average transition zone thickness of 241 km. Our most robust observation is provided by comparing the stack of all NW back-azimuth arrivals versus all SE back-azimuth arrivals. This shows that the transition zone thickness varies between 261 and 232 km, between the NW and SE portions of our line. More spatially resolved images show that this transition zone thickness variation results from the occurrence of 20--30 km of topography over 200--300 lateral scale lengths on the 410- and 660-km discontinuities. The topography on the 410- and 660-km discontinuities is not correlated either positively or negatively beneath the 600-km-long transect, albeit correlation could be present for wavelengths larger than the length of our transect. If this discontinuity topography is controlled exclusively by thermal effects, then uncorrelated 250$\,^{\circ}$ lateral temperature variations are required at the 410- and 660-km discontinuities. However, other sources of discontinuity topography such as the effects of garnet-pyroxene phase transformations, chemical layering, or variations in mantle hydration may contribute. The most obvious correlation between the discontinuity structure and the track of the Yellowstone hotspot is the downward dip of the 410-km discontinuity from 415 km beneath the NW margin of the YHT to 435 km beneath the easternmost extent of Basin and Range faulting. Assuming this topography is thermally controlled, the warmest mantle resides not beneath the Yellowstone hotspot track, but 150 km to the SE along the easternmost edge of the active Basin and Range faulting.},

The detailed broadband receiver functions are obtained by stacking source-equalized horizontal components of teleseismic P waveforms. The resulting receiver functions are most sensitive to the shear velocity structure near the station. A time domain inversion routine utilizes the radial receiver function to determine this structure assuming a crustal model parameterized by many thin, flat-lying, homogeneous layers. Lateral changes in structure are identified by examining azimuthal variations in the vertical structure. The results reveal significant rapid lateral changes in the midcrustal structure beneath the station that are interpreted in relation to the origin of the East Continent Gravity High located northeast of RSCP. The results from events arriving from the northeast show a high-velocity midcrustal layer not present in results from the southeast azimuth. This velocity structure can be shown to support the idea that this feature is part of a Keweenawan rift system. Another interesting feature of the derived velocity models is the indication that the crust-mantle boundary beneath the Cumberland Plateau is a thick, probably laminated transition zone between the depths of 40 and 55 km, a result consistent with interpretations of early refraction work in the area.},

	Abstract = {Delay times from teleseismic and local P wave arrivals are used to invert for a high-resolution three-dimensional velocity model beneath the northwest Pacific. The model shows high-velocity slabs with average velocity anomalies of the order of 3--4{\%}. Assuming the positive velocity deviations in the subducting lithosphere are to first order due to a temperature anomaly, the results of a theoretical slab temperature profile based on the diffusion equation are converted to a synthetic slab velocity model. Temperature variations between the ambient mantle and the interior of the slab are converted to P wave velocity perturbations using dVp/dT ≈ 4.8 × 10−4 km s−1 $\,^{\circ}$C−1. A nonlinear optimization scheme compares the tomograms obtained via tomography to the theoretically predicted models in order to determine the optimal values for slab thickness and mantle potential temperature. Using 1180$\pm$100$\,^{\circ}$C as the potential temperature, thickness estimates of 88$\pm$8 km, 85$\pm$8 km, and 84$\pm$8 km are obtained for the Izu-Bonin, Japan, and Kuril slabs, respectively. A correlation exists between slab thickness and age, which is strong if mantle temperature variations along the slab strike can be ruled out. In the process of estimating slab thickness the predicted slab velocity model is used as a filter to enhance the initial minimum-norm tomographic result. The initial tomogram is modified to closely resemble the synthetic slab tomogram by using only null-space components. The use of the null-space components guarantees that the enhanced solution will satisfy the original seismic delay times. The enhanced slab images show very continuous and narrow slabs compared to the initial tomographic results.},

	Abstract = {Delay times of compressional body wave phases from both teleseismic and local events are used to invert for a high-resolution P wave velocity model in the Tonga subduction zone. The images obtained show a high-velocity subducting slab with velocity deviations of the order of 3--4{\%}. Assuming to first order that the positive velocity anomalies within the slab are caused by a temperature effect, a theoretical slab temperature model based on the diffusion equation is used to explain velocity anomalies within the tomographic slab. Temperature differences between the interior of the slab and the ambient mantle are converted to velocity perturbations using the scaling parameter dVp/dT ≈ 4.8 × 10−4 km s−1 $\,^{\circ}$C−1 for lithosphere material. The optimal values for the parameters in the temperature model are found using a nonlinear optimization that compares the integrated velocity anomalies in the tomographic slab region to integral of high velocities in a synthetic slab derived from a temperature model. The parameters for slab thickness and mantle potential temperature are not uniquely determined; therefore a fixed value for the mantle potential temperature based on laboratory values for the temperature of the spinel-to-perovskite transition at 660 km is used. Using 1180$\,^{\circ}$C as the potential temperature, the theoretical temperature model gives an optimal slab thickness of 82 km for a region near 29$\,^{\circ}$S in Tonga. The uncertainty in the thickness is dominated by the uncertainty in the mantle temperature and would be 8 km for an uncertainty of 100$\,^{\circ}$ in mantle temperature, but nonsystematic errors are less. In order to enhance the tomographic result the velocity model is biased towards the theoretical slab model. However, a posteriori changes made to the tomogram will most likely violate the fit to the delay time data. To prevent this, the difference between the tomogram and the predicted slab model is projected onto the null-space of the inversion to remove components which do not satisfy the seismic data. Using only null-space components to modify the minimum-norm solution, an enhanced model is obtained which has been biased toward the theoretical solution but has the same data misfit as the minimum-norm solution. The final image shows a very narrow and continuous slab with maximum velocity anomalies of the order of 6--7{\%}; many of the gaps within the slab, as well as artifacts around the slab which were present in the minimum-norm solution, are absent in the biased image.},

	Abstract = {This is the final installment in a four-part sequence that examines the nature of mantle layering required by the multiple-ScS phases and internal reflections observed within the reverberative interval of SH-polarized seismograms. In this paper, long-period, SH-polarized, multiple-ScS phases reflected once from a mantle discontinuity (first-order reverberations) are used to search for abrupt shear-wave impedance contrasts in the lower mantle. Beneath the geographic regions sampled, the depth interval of 1000--2600 km (Bullen's region D′) appears free of any distinct, radial layering, in agreement with the majority of recent seismic models and the notion of near-adiabatic compression of a compositionally homogeneous lower mantle. To pass undetected, discontinuities in D′ must be either small (SH-polarized reflection coefficient R0{\textless}1.0{\%}), highly intermittent or subject to lateral depth variations well in excess of 50 km. At greater depths, corresponding to the D″ region of the lowermost mantle, we find evidence for a reflector of long-period seismic energy situated an average of 325 km above the core-mantle boundary (CMB), similar to the discontinuity proposed by T. Lay and coworkers. Our results indicate a 4.4{\%} increase in shear wave impedance and a 1.7{\%} increase in density if the 2.75{\%} increase in shear velocity proposed by Lay and Helmberger (1983) holds true for our study area. The discontinuity is observed beneath less than one-third of the 18 seismic corridors examined and does not appear to be a ubiquitous feature of the lower mantle. This, plus an observed correlation of discontinuity depth and lower-mantle velocity heterogeneity, and the lack of experimental evidence for deep-mantle phase transformations strongly favor a compositional origin. Mantle-side layering nearer the CMB, perhaps associated with a thin chemical boundary layer, would mimic the effects of the surface crust, producing a complex wave train of first- and higher-order reverberations superposed upon all other reverberative interval arrivals. If present and unaccounted for, CMB structure would drive estimates of crustal structure and QScS obtained by multiple-ScS waveform inversion away from their true values. Compared to independent estimates, our results admit little bias. Monte Carlo tests are used to assess the sensitivity of this technique to CMB layering, which decreases with decreasing boundary layer thickness. Nonetheless, the results limit CMB transition zones in excess of 20 km to impedance contrasts less than 12{\%} (8{\%} for a 40-km transition) beneath much of the western Pacific, Australia, Melanesia, and Indonesia.},

	Abstract = {This is the first paper in a four-part sequence that examines the nature of mantle layering required by the multiple-ScS phases and internal reflections observed within the reverberative interval of SH-polarized seismograms. Here we present path-averaged estimates of the two-way travel times through the crust+mantle ($\tau$ScS) and crust alone ($\tau$M), the whole mantle quality factor (QScS) and the reflection coefficient at the M discontinuity (R0(zM)) obtained by iterative waveform inversion of ScS reverberations. We show that QScS estimates derived from direct waveform inversion can be biased significantly if reverberations originating within the crust are ignored, especially in continental regions where the crust is thick. Applying our technique, which explicitly models crustal reverberations, we substantially expand the geographical coverage of $\tau$ScS and QScS measurements available from previous studies. The $\tau$ScS data correlate well with whole mantle travel times predicted by the Harvard tomographic models. Both the $\tau$ScS data and the QScS data support the hypothesis that variations in velocity and attenuation structure between old continents and oceans persist to depths of several hundred kilometers. In particular, the value of QScS derived for paths crossing stable continent is very high (280$\pm$30 at 30 mHz) compared with that for mature ocean basin (189$\pm$16), consistent with the thick-plate model of cratons requiring that differences in thermal structure extend to several hundred kilometers. The crustal thicknesses implied by the observations of path-averaged $\tau$M are consistent with those inferred from short-range refraction data, gravity measurements, and surface topography. The path-averaged reflectivity of the M discontinuity is also tectonically correlated, becoming brighter as the percentage of continental crust encountered along the path increases. This result implies that, on average, the impedance at the base of the continental crust is significantly lower than at the base of the oceanic crust.},

	Abstract = {This is the second paper in a four-part sequence that examines the nature of mantle layering using the ScSn phases and internal reflections observed within the reverberative interval of SH-polarized seismograms. Mantle reflectivity profiles for 18 seismic corridors sampling portions of Indonesia, Australia, and the western and central Pacific are constructed from low-frequency (25-mHz) ScS reverberations; i.e, ScSn-type phases reflected once from internal mantle discontinuities. Modeling the reflectivity profiles using synthetic seismograms yields precise, path-specific estimates of the travel times to the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities and their reflection coefficients. The data are consistent with an olivine-dominated model of the transition zone, marked by two major phase transitions having average apparent depths of 414$\pm$2 km and 660$\pm$2 km and impedance contrasts of 0.046$\pm$0.010 and 0.072$\pm$0.010, respectively. The interpath variations observed in the reverberation travel times imply that the topography on the two discontinuities is of the order of 20 km (peak to peak) and is negatively correlated, consistent with an endothermic transition at 660 km whose Clapeyron slope magnitude is comparable to that of the 410-km (exothermic) transition. In the case of the 660-km discontinuity, we have been able to supplement these long-wavelength (1500--5000 km) observations with an estimate of intrapath topography, inferred from the frequency dependence of the 660-km reflection coefficient, which gives peak-to-peak variations less than 40 km on scale lengths of 500--1500 km. For the 660-km discontinuity, the observed topography is significantly less than the dynamic topography expected for a simple compositional interface in regions of subduction. However, we do observed an intriguing negative correlation between the apparent depth and the reflection coefficient of the 660-km discontinuity which may involve small compositional variations. Plausible explanations for this correlation include heating of an initially cool chemical boundary layer gravitationally trapped above an endothermic phase transition, loss of reflected energy due to local curvature (or roughness) of the reflector, and/or extreme topography occurring on a small compositional component to the discontinuity (≤40{\%} of the total impedance contrast). By stripping the 410-km and 660-km peaks from the composite path reflectivity profile, we identify three minor reflectors at mean depths of 520, 710, and 900 km. The shallowest may mark the $\beta$-phase → $\gamma$-spinel phase transition. The 710-km discontinuity can be attributed to the ilmenite (gamet) → perovskite phase transition, although changes in perovskite symmetry can potentially provide explanations for both the 710-km and 900-km features.},

We use seismic data collected from 24 broadband stations in northeast China. Analysis of these data shows that the 660 km discontinuity is locally depressed in the region from longitude 128.0$\,^{\circ}$E to 130.5$\,^{\circ}$E and latitude 40.0$\,^{\circ}$N to 44.0$\,^{\circ}$N, and then it splits into multiple discontinuities in the surrounding regions. The complexity of the 660 km discontinuity beneath the subduction zones is probably attributable to the interaction between the upper mantle and subducted slab. We speculate that the flattening of the subducted lithosphere near the bottom of the upper mantle causes the multiple discontinuity structure, and that the slab penetrating the 660 km discontinuity into the lower mantle causes the narrow 660 km depression area.},

	Abstract = {An increasing number of seismological studies indicate that slabs of subducted lithosphere penetrate the Earth's lower mantle below some island arcs but are deflected, or, rather, laid down, in the transition zone below others. Recent numerical simulations of mantle flow also advocate a hybrid form of mantle convection, with intermittent layering. We present a multi-disciplinary analysis of slab morphology and mantle dynamics in which we account explicitly for the history of subduction below specific island arcs in an attempt to understand what controls lateral variations in slab morphology and penetration depth. Central in our discussion are the Izu-Bonin and Mariana subduction zones. We argue that the differences in the tectonic evolution of these subduction zones---in particular the amount and rate of trench migration---can explain why the slab of subducted oceanic lithosphere seems to be (at least temporarily) stagnant in the Earth's transition zone below the Izu-Bonin arc but penetrates into the lower mantle below the Mariana arc. We briefly speculate on the applicability of our model of the temporal and spatial evolution of slab morphology to other subduction zones. Although further investigation is necessary, our tentative model shows the potential for interpreting seismic images of slab structure by accounting for the plate-tectonic history of the subduction zones involved. We therefore hope that the ideas outlined here will stimulate and direct new research initiatives.},

	Abstract = {The P wave velocity structure beneath the Western Pacific is found from the International Seismological Center first arrival data. Special attention was paid to the deep structure beneath the Wadati-Benioff zone. We discretized the whole mantle into blocks with finer blocks in the region of interest to obtain the velocities of all the blocks. This way of discretization minimizes a problem with tomographic studies of regional scale: difficulty in making corrections for the effects outside the region of interest. Our solution is iterative with the alternate step of the relocation of earthquakes, using the whole mantle model of Inoue et al. (1990) as a starting model. A first-order smoothness constraint was imposed to suppress the possible fluctuation of the solution around the initial model. The essential result depends little on whether the reference spherical model is smooth or discontinuous near 400- and 670-km depths. We examined the resolution by calculating the resolving kernels for selected blocks and by reconstructing the checkerboard test patterns of velocity perturbation and the test structures of subducting lithosphere. The resolution is depth dependent but in general good enough to see the slab configuration beneath the Southern Kurile-Japan-Izu-Bonin arcs and the Java arc. It is relatively poor beneath the Northern Kurile and Mariana arcs. The seismic image of subducting slab beneath the Southern Kurile to Bonin arcs bends to subhorizontal near the leading edge of the Wadati-Benioff zone and extends continentward over a distance of more than 1000 km. The subhorizontal portion of the slab connects a high-velocity blob to the bottom that reaches a depth of at least 800 km across the 670-km discontinuity under the Japan arc. Although the image of the Java slab directly penetrates the 670-km discontinuity, it then bends to a shallow dip with a considerable spread, reaching a depth of about 1200 km. These results suggest that descending slabs of lithosphere in the Western Pacific tend to be stagnant in the transition zone under a subtle control of the 670-km discontinuity. Although stagnant slab materials eventually descend into the lower mantle, they no longer maintain their original configuration below the 670-km discontinuity.},

	Abstract = {Using triplicate waveforms, we construct 34 seismic profiles east of Taiwan to investigate lateral variations of P and S wave speeds (VP and VS) near the mantle transition zone. Data from broadband and densely spaced, short-period arrays are combined to achieve high resolution. We find correspondingly high VS in the back arc of Izu-Bonin where the Northern Philippine Sea Anomaly (NPSA) was previously delineated in the lower portion of the transition zone by an average VP that is 1.5 $\pm$ 0.5{\%} higher than the surrounding regions. High VS of the NPSA reduces the contrast in VS across the 660-km discontinuity ($\Delta$VS) to about 3.9{\%}, consistent with the notion that NPSA reflects a subhorizontal remnant of cold Pacific slab, resting immediately above the lower mantle. The aseismic NPSA contrasts the Fiji-Tonga region where many outboard earthquakes, low VP and VS and seismic anisotropy mark a large-scale, petrologic anomaly. The contrasting pattern implies that the NPSA is no longer cold enough to preserve materials such as metastable olivine or volatiles that can trigger earthquakes, reduce VP and VS, and cause anisotropy. In regions surrounding the NPSA, $\Delta$VS is well constrained to be 5.9 $\pm$ 0.5{\%}. This precise result and known impedance contrast (∼7{\%}) under the Japan Sea lead to a density contrast ($\Delta$$\rho$) of about 8{\%}, circumventing the trade-off between $\Delta$$\rho$ and $\Delta$VS. The magnitude of $\Delta$$\rho$ is higher than recent estimates (∼5{\%}) without independent control on $\Delta$VS, but close to longstanding global models, implying considerable resistance to slab penetration into the lower mantle north of the NPSA.},

	Abstract = {Stacked images combining over 5 years of long-period Global Digital Seismograph Network data reveal many phases associated with reflections and conversions from upper mantle discontinuities. These images show travel time and amplitude relative to a reference phase which is aligned and normalized on all seismograms prior to stacking. Results obtained for P, S, SS, and PP reference arrivals resolve numerous phases from discontinuities near 410 and 660 km, while some of the stacks also show evidence for a weaker discontinuity near 520 km. Phases of particular interest include P and SH multiples resulting from topside reflections, precursors to SS from underside reflections, and P-to-SV converted phases. These phases can be clearly seen both in the waveform stacks and in cross-correlation analysis of individual seismograms. Travel times for these arrivals are converted to discontinuity depths relative to velocities in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model, and empirical corrections are applied for the effects of lateral velocity variations in the upper mantle. Average apparent depths to the discontinuities for the different phases agree to within $\pm$3 km for the 410-km discontinuity, to within $\pm$4 km for the 520-km discontinuity, and to within $\pm$8 km for the 660-km discontinuity. The best global averages are obtained from the SS precursor data which indicate discontinuities at 415, 519, and 659 km. Discontinuity depths obtained from the P-to-SV converted phases at over 35 individual seismic stations exhibit variations of less than $\pm$20 km. Apparent depths to the 660-km discontinuity consistently show greater variability than depths to the 410-km discontinuity, supporting recent laboratory results which indicate that the Clapeyron slope for the 660-km discontinuity is significantly larger in magnitude than the slope for the 410-km discontinuity. Precursors to SS (seen between 110$\,^{\circ}$ and 180$\,^{\circ}$) are particularly useful for mapping possible lateral variations in discontinuity depths since each arrival can be associated with a single underside reflection point Apparent discontinuity depths computed from SS precursors for different tectonic regions agree to within about $\pm$5 km. The SS precursors have especially good coverage near the subducting slabs in the northwest Pacific. Analysis of apparent discontinuity depths in this area suggests the presence of a broad 1000- to 1500-km-wide region near the slab in which the 660-km discontinuity is depressed by about 20 km. Measuring absolute amplitudes for these phases is difficult due to the large corrections required to compensate for the effects of incoherent stacking. Relative amplitude analysis suggests that the P and S wave impedance changes at 410 km are about 0.8--1.1 times the size of the changes at 660 km and that the contrasts at 520 km are between 0.3 and 0.6 of the changes at 410 km.},

Progess has been driven largely by the increasing size, quality and accessibility of digital seismic datasets from global and regional networks and from experiments using portable instruments. This paper focuses on a few of the most interesting and important developments. These include: (1) measurements of upper mantle anisotropy, obtained using a variety of techniques, which can reveal details of the flow regimes and tectonic history of the upper mantle, (2) improvements in models of upper mantle velocity and attenuation structure, with some controversy arising regarding how deep slow velocity anomalies extend beneath oceanic ridges, (3) direct seismic observations of topography on the 410- and 660-km discontinuities in the upper mantle, providing constraints on mantle temperatures and dynamics, and (4) observations suggesting secondary seismic discontinuities in some regions.},

	Abstract = {Systematic stacks of P wave receiver functions (Pds) for 118 global seismic stations yield new transition zone thickness (WTZ) estimates, as measured by the difference in depths between the 410- and 660-km mantle discontinuities. The receiver functions are computed from high signal-to-noise records of earthquakes between 1976 and 2002 recorded at distances of 30$\,^{\circ}$ to 90$\,^{\circ}$. We obtain a globally averaged transition zone thickness of 242 $\pm$ 2 km, in good agreement with SS precursor (SdS) results. Previously noted differences in average WTZ between Pds and SdS studies are caused by both geographic bias and the constant ray parameter approximation used in many prior Pds studies, which causes a ∼4 km overestimation of WTZ. Pds observations suggest lateral variations in WTZ of $\pm$20 km with maximal variations of $\pm$35 km and a long-wavelength topography pattern that agrees with SS precursor results showing thick WTZ beneath cold subduction zones and thin WTZ beneath warmer regions.},

	Abstract = {The jumps in seismic velocity and density near 410- and 660-km depths have been postulated to mark phase changes in a locally, chemically homogeneous mantle. Seismic estimates of upper mantle discontinuity thickness and lateral variability have varied, posing difficulties for assessing models with chemical and phase transition layering. Observations of underside high-frequency (∼1 Hz) P wave reflections from the 410- and 660-km discontinuity that precede the P′P′ phase provide unique constraints on the physical properties of these dynamically critical features. We have collected high-quality recordings of P′P′ and its precursors from three sources: the California Seismic Network, the Large Aperture Seismic Array in Montana, and the Global Seismic Network. The array and regional network data have great sensitivity to weak P′P′ precursors, whereas the global network recordings have good geographical distribution of bounce points. The only consistently observed reflections originate from depths near 410 km and 660 km. The reflector observed near 520-km depth with longer period waves, which has been interpreted as the olivine $\beta$--$\gamma$ phase transition, is too small in impedance contrast or too thick to reflect 1-Hz P waves. Data from all three networks indicate that the 1-Hz P waves from the ``660'' are bigger than those from the ``410.'' Although large variability in P′P′ and its precursors' amplitudes prevents strong conclusions, we show that the P′P′ precursor amplitudes, travel time dispersion, and frequency content are consistent with a sharp (≤2 km) 660 and a more diffuse 410, consistent with mineral physics predictions.},

Underside reflections from these discontinuities arrive as precursors to the SS phase, and their timing can be used to obtain global variations of the depth to the reflectors. We analyze over 13,000 records from events mb{\textgreater}5.5, focal depth {\textless}75 km, and range 110$\,^{\circ}$ to 180$\,^{\circ}$ by picking and aligning on SS, then stacking the records along the theoretical travel time curves for the discontinuity reflections. Separate stacks are obtained for 416 equally spaced caps of 10$\,^{\circ}$ radius; clear 410- and 660-km reflections are visible for almost all of the caps while 520-km reflections are seen in about half of the caps. The differential travel times between the precursors and the SS arrival are measured on each stack, with uncertainty estimates obtained using a bootstrap resampling method. We then compute discontinuity depths relative to the isotropic Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) at 40-s period, correcting for surface topography and crustal thickness variations using the CRUST5.0 model of Mooney et al. [1995], and for upper mantle S velocity heterogeneity using model S16B30 of Masters et al. [1996]. The resulting maps of discontinuity topography have more complete coverage than previous studies; observed depths are highly correlated between adjacent caps and appear dominated by large-scale topography variations. The 660-km discontinuity exhibits peak-to-peak topography of about 38 km, with regional depressions that correlate with areas of current and past subduction around the Pacific Ocean. Large-scale topography on the 410-km discontinuity is lower in amplitude and largely uncorrelated with the topography on the 660-km interface. The width of the transition zone, WTZ, as measured by the separation between the 410- and 660-km discontinuities, appears thickest in areas of active subduction (e.g., Kurils, Philippines, and Tonga) and thins beneath Antarctica and much of the central Pacific Ocean. Spatial variations in WTZ appear unrelated to ocean-continent differences but do roughly correlate with the S16B30 velocities in the transition zone, consistent with a common thermal origin for both patterns. The lower-amplitude 520-km reflector is more difficult to resolve but appears to be a global feature as it is observed preferentially for those bounce point caps with the most data.},

	Abstract = {The inner core of the Earth has been interpreted as being elastically anisotropic, with the direction parallel to the rotation axis fast. There are also observations that north--south rays exhibit greater amplitude reduction and more complex waveforms. In previous work, we found that directionally solidified, polycrystalline, tin (Sn)-rich alloys exhibit a solidification texturing that is measurable ultrasonically, and suggested that such texturing might be a cause for the observed seismic elastic anisotropy. Here, we find that zinc (Zn)-rich alloys also exhibit a measurable elastic anisotropy that is due to a preferred growth direction. We confirm the grain orientation by back-reflection X-ray diffraction. Zn solidifies as a hexagonal closest-packed (hcp) metal, albeit one with a c/a ratio greater than the ideal, unlike hcp iron (Fe), and is 60{\%} elastically anisotropic. We also find that the columnar dendritic grains that grow with a preferred orientation during directional solidification result in anisotropic scattering off grain boundaries, yielding an anisotropic apparent attenuation. In addition, we present results for directionally solidified 100{\%} Zn, which exhibits qualitative differences in both the elastic and attenuation anisotropy from Zn alloys. The laboratory results can be interpreted as a cause for both the seismic elastic and attenuation anisotropy if the cooling near the inner core has more nearly cylindrical than spherical symmetry.},

	Abstract = {We have measured both the differential travel times and the amplitude ratios of core phases PKP(DF) and PKP(BC), observed on digital broadband records worldwide, and analyzed them jointly, in order to try and distinguish between the effects of lateral heterogeneity and anisotropy in the inner core, and to test different hypotheses on the possible origin of such anisotropy. For the best quality data, we observe a correlation between stronger attenuation and faster velocities on a global scale, confirming earlier results obtained beneath Africa. Regional variations are observed in this relationship. In addition, for paths which have their turning point in equatorial regions, both the velocity and attenuation show clear dependence on the angle $\Theta$ of the ray path in the inner core with the Earth's rotation axis. By contrast, for paths with turning points at higher latitudes, this dependence is apparent only in the travel times. The ray azimuth at its turning point, computed in a reference system with a slightly tilted symmetry axis with respect to the Earth's rotation, appears to be a more successful parameter for analyzing anisotropy. The velocity-attenuation correlation suggests that crystal orientation is responsible for both the travel time and attenuation anisotropy, and that the heterogeneity level inside the inner core must be small. However, in order to investigate the pattern of anisotropy in more detail, simple models expressed in terms of $\Theta$ alone are no longer adequate, and more complex parametrization, possibly related to convective processes, will have to be considered.},

	Abstract = {During the last decade, the presence of velocity anisotropy inside the inner core, with a fast axis parallel to the Earth's rotation axis, has been well established. The quantitative analysis of the amplitudes of waves which sample a particular region of the inner core, under Africa, but exhibit various orientations allows us to document and characterize the presence of anisotropy in attenuation. The analysis is based on a comparison of both amplitudes and travel times of the PKP(DF) wave, which samples the inner core, and the PKP(BC) wave, which has nearly the same path but bottoms inside the liquid core. The data reveal that the direction of strong attenuation correlates with that of fast velocity. When referred to the same epicentral distance and focal depth, the PKP(DF)/PKP(BC) amplitude ratio are about five times lower for paths tilted by 25$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the Earth rotation axis, than for nearly equatorial paths. A clear negative correlation is observed between travel time and amplitude residuals, when the angle to Earth rotation axis varies. This first quantitative analysis, combined with experimental results on oriented crystals and mushy media, may bring important constraints on the mechanism responsible for anisotropy in the inner core.},

	Abstract = {The main goal of this study is to check the existence of an innermost inner core with a radius of about 300 km and a different anisotropy [Ishii, M., Dziewonski, A.M., 2003. Distinct seismic anisotropy at the centre of the Earth. Phys. Earth Planet. Int. 140, 203--217]. We first compute the sensitivity kernels of PKP(DF), the seismic P-wave which samples the inner core, in a transversely isotropic medium. Owing to their long paths, PKP(DF) phases have a Fresnel zone inside the inner core which is as large as the innermost inner core radius for a 2 s dominant period. To enhance the inner core cylindrical structure and improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the data, PKP(DF) traveltime residuals from bulletins are computed for summary rays using two different stacking procedures. These data are then inverted to obtain radial anisotropic models of the inner core with a symmetry axis parallel to Earth's rotation axis, using both finite-frequency and ray theories. We do not observe significant differences between the two theories because of the dominant effect of PKP(DF) residuals averaging, and of the model parametrization. However, the inversions show that the method to average traveltime residuals as well as the a priori assumptions both influence the final model. The same data can be explained by three families of models which all exhibit anisotropy with fast axis parallel to Earth's rotation axis in the external part of the inner core (from the inner core boundary to a radius around 450 km) but which reveal very different innermost inner core structures: (I) a weak anisotropy with a slow symmetry axis parallel to Earth's rotation axis; (II) a nearly isotropic innermost inner core; (III) a strong anisotropy with a fast symmetry axis parallel to Earth's rotation axis. These models have very different implications for the origin of the anisotropy and the history of Earth's core.},

	Abstract = {We propose to model the uppermost inner core as an aggregate of randomly oriented anisotropic ``patches''. A patch is defined as an assemblage of a possibly large number of crystals with identically oriented crystallographic axes. This simple model accounts for the observed velocity isotropy of short period body waves, and offers a reasonable physical interpretation for the scatterers detected at the top of the inner core. From rigorous multiple scattering modeling of seismic wave propagation through the aggregate, we obtain strong constraints on both the size and the elastic constants of iron patches. In a first step, we study the phase velocity and scattering attenuation of aggregates composed of hexagonal and cubic crystals, whose elastic constants have been published in the mineral physics literature. The predicted attenuations for P waves vary over two orders of magnitude. Our calculations demonstrate that scattering attenuation is extremely sensitive to the anisotropic properties of single crystals and offers an attractive way to discriminate among iron models with e.g. identical Voigt average speeds. When anisotropy of elastic patches is pronounced, we find that the S wavespeed in the aggregate can be as much as 15{\%} lower than the Voigt average shear velocity of a single crystal. In a second step, we perform a systematic search for iron models compatible with measured seismic velocities and attenuations. An iron model is characterized by its symmetry (cubic or hexagonal), elastic constants, and patch size. Independent of the crystal symmetry, we infer a most likely size of patch of the order of 400 m. Recent bcc iron models from the literature are in very good agreement with the most probable elastic constants of cubic crystals found in our inversion. Our study (1) suggests that the presence of melt may not be required to explain the low shear wavespeeds in the inner core and (2) supports the recent experimental results on the stability of cubic iron in the inner core, at least in its upper part.},

	Abstract = {The Earth's core is composed primarily of iron with several per cent by weight of lighter elements, which are thought to be progressively enriched in the outer liquid core as the core cools and the inner core crystallizes. Detailed profiles of P-wave speed (Vp) of the outermost core might be affected by this process. In this study, we constrain the radial Vp structure in the outermost 600 km of the core by analysing SmKS multiples with m up to 6, which are observed at large-scale broad-band seismometer arrays. Array processing of SmKS waves combined with investigation of their CMB piercing points clearly demonstrate that the array averaged SmKS differential traveltime anomalies primarily reflect the Vp structure in the outermost core. A $\tau$−p inversion is applied to the SmKS (m = 2, 3, 4 and 5) differential times measured by the array processing. The inversion reveals that the Vp is 0.45 per cent slower at the CMB than Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) and the lower Vp anomaly gradually diminishes to zero at 300 km below the CMB. The deviation of the Vp gradient from PREM of the outermost 300 km of the core is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the deeper part of the core. The evaluation of Birch's parameter 1 − g−1d$\Phi$/dr ($\Phi$ = V2p) for the obtained Vp profile as well as the change in the Vp gradient with depth show that adiabatic self-compression of a homogeneous material cannot explain the observations. Waveforms corresponding to the arrivals of S6KS waves are consistent with the Vp profile of the topmost 50 km of the outer core, and agree with the results from the $\tau$−p inversion. This excludes the presence of a high Vp--low density layer thicker than 10 km immediately beneath the CMB.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The Earth's outer core appears to be compositionally layered. Exotic mechanisms such as an original chemically layered core preserved from the Earth's accretionary period, or compositionally different core material delivered by a Moon-creating impactor are conceivable, but require a core whose outermost part has been stratified throughout core history, relying on unknowable processes to achieve. Barodiffusion and core-mantle reaction lead to layers significantly thinner than observed. We show that a balance of mass transferred from the inner core to the top of the outer core is possible, and that the stratification could arise as a byproduct of light element accumulation. However, if a subadiabatic thermal gradient at the top of the outer core exists that quells radial flow, it could serve as a witness of light element accumulation by preventing mixing with the convecting part of the core. The temperature difference through a subadiabatic layer could be 80--300 K and carry heat fluxes through the core-mantle boundary of 0.5--23 TW, given uncertainty in core properties.},

We compare four different seismic models of inner core anisotropy, which were obtained by others using the splitting of Earth's normal modes. These models have been developed using a self-coupling (SC) approximation, which assumes that coupling between nearby modes through anisotropic inner core structure is negligible. We test the SC approximation by comparing the frequencies and quality factors of 90 inner core sensitive modes, computed for these models using either the SC approximation or full-coupling (FC) among large groups of modes. We find significant shifts in the quality factors and frequencies for some modes. Groups of modes which significantly couple together are constructed for six target modes. These groups are model dependent and in some cases contain large numbers of modes. Synthetic seismograms are calculated to show that the difference between SC and FC is observable on the scale of seismograms and of the same order of magnitude as the difference between synthetic and observed seismograms. Thus, future models of inner core anisotropy should take cross-coupling between large groups of modes into account.},

	Abstract = {Illustrative calculations are presented of the effect of the coupling of large groups of Earth's normal modes in a realistic 3-D earth model. In previous work the effect of modal splitting and coupling has been treated either in the self-coupling approximation (SC) or in the group-coupling approximation (GC), also known as quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. In SC a mode is treated as isolated in the spectrum and the theory of degenerate splitting is used to calculate the effect of lateral heterogeneity, rotation and ellipticity on each individual modal multiplet. In GC a small number of modes close together in frequency are treated as a group and the effect of coupling within the group is included. Of course, SC can be considered as a special case of GC in which there is only a single modal multiplet in the group. In principle, modal spectra are affected by coupling among all modes. Given that explicit calculations can be performed only for a finite collection of modes, we are led to consider the question of how large the group of modes considered must be in order to obtain theoretical spectra of sufficient accuracy for a given purpose. The particular purpose that we have in mind is the use of modal spectra to refine 3-D models of earth structure. To do this we carry out calculations in which the results of SC and GC are compared with those of full coupling (FC), by which we mean coupling calculations including large collections of multiplets, for example all modes having frequencies less than a certain upper bound or cut-off frequency. The results indicate that SC and GC often represent a poor approximation to FC. The differences in modal spectra calculated using SC/GC and those obtained using FC are, in many cases, comparable to the differences between observed and theoretical spectra. We compare FC for all 140 spheroidal and toroidal modes up to 3 mHz with GC using the 25 pairs of modes defined by Resovsky {\&} Ritzwoller (1998) and with GC in 33 subgroups of spheroidal and toroidal modes. We find that full coupling is needed to obtain the best synthetic spectra. The matrices for full coupling of 140 modes become large (approximately 2500×2500), but are still tractable.},

Analysis of the ScSp arrivals provides information about the sharpness and the location of these boundaries. It is inferred from ScSp arrivals that the boundaries are characterized by velocity contrasts of at least 5 per cent over transition zones of at most a few kilometers. In general, locations of the boundaries inferred from ScSp observations agree with locations inferred from seismicity except beneath central Peru. In central Peru the seismicity at depth is diffuse. It has been proposed on the basis of that seismicity that the downgoing plate dips at a gentle 10$\,^{\circ}$; the ScSp observations, however, suggest that the Nazca plate has a dip of ∼30$\,^{\circ}$. },

One model, based primarily on the distribution of hypocentres thought to be most reliably located, postulates a shallow (∼ 10$\,^{\circ}$) dip for the downgoing plate. The second model, re-examined in this paper and based chiefly on an analysis of ScSp converted phases, postulates a normal (∼ 30$\,^{\circ}$) dip for the subduction.A detailed examination of ScSp data for central Peru and central Chile shows that ScSp arrivals can be identified on all seismograms on which the predicted signal/noise ratio is greater than 1, and the measured amplitude ratios of ScSp to ScS imply a normal dip for the conversion interfaces. The characteristics of the ScSp arrivals in these regions are virtually identical to those for ScSp arrivals in southern Peru, where a well-defined Benioff zone and the calculated ScSp-conversion region both imply a normal dip for the subduction. Hence ScSp observations in South America support the model of an approximately constant dip of subduction from central Peru to central Chile to a depth of at least 120 km, and impose a constraint that must be satisfied by any satisfactory tectonic model for these regions.},

	Abstract = {We model broadband seismograms containing triplicated S, S2, and S3 along with ScS to produce a pure path one-dimensional model extending from the crust to the core-mantle boundary beneath the East Pacific Rise. We simultaneously model all body wave shapes and amplitudes, thereby eliminating depth-velocity ambiguities. The data consist of western North American broadband recordings of East Pacific Rise (EPR) affiliate transform events that form a continuous record section out to 82$\,^{\circ}$ and sample nearly the entire East Pacific Rise. The best fitting synthetics contain attenuation and small changes in lithospheric thickness needed to correct for variation in bounce point ages. The 660-km discontinuity is particularly well resolved and requires a steep gradient (4{\%}), extending down to 745 km. We find no discernible variation in apparent depths of the 405- and 660-km discontinuities over ridge-orthogonal distances on the order of 1000 km (or 20 Ma lithosphere). Body waveform comparisons indicate that we can resolve discontinuity depths to less than $\pm$10 km, providing an upper limit to transition zone topography. These depth estimates, in conjunction with the fan shot nature of the ray paths, lower the detection limit from S2 precursor analysis of the lateral length scale over which short-wavelength topographic variation could occur and indicate the sub-EPR Transition Zone and upper mantle are remarkably homogeneous. The lower mantle beneath the East Pacific Rise is well modeled by PREM, with the greatest variation occurring in ScS, reflecting strong heterogeneity along the core-mantle boundary. Together, these observations require that the East Pacific Rise spreading ridge cannot be actively supplied from the local lower mantle and that tomographically imaged lateral variation beneath the ridge likely reflects lateral smearing of outlying velocity gradients. Dynamically, the transition zone therefore appears vertically decoupled from the overlying East Pacific Rise spreading system.},

	Abstract = {Recordings of deep Tonga earthquakes from two arrays of 12 broadband seismographs each in the Fiji and Tonga islands are stacked and searched for reflections and conversions from upper mantle discontinuities in the Tonga subduction zone. The arrays operated as part of the Seismic Arrays in Fiji and Tonga (SAFT) experiment from July 2001 to August 2002. In comparison with the commonly used teleseismic approaches, the short path lengths for the local data provide smaller Fresnel zones and high-frequency content for precise mapping of discontinuity topography and sharpness. To enhance the low-amplitude discontinuity phases s410p, P660p and S660p, deconvolved seismograms from each event/array pair are aligned on the maximum amplitude of the direct P wave and subsequently slant stacked. For the 410-km discontinuity, the results show no systematic variations in depth with distance to the cold slab. The 660-km discontinuity varies between 656 and 714 km in depth. For the southern and central parts of the subduction zone, the largest depths occur in the core of the Tonga slab. For the northern part, two separate depressions of the 660-km discontinuity are observed. These anomalies are interpreted as being induced by the active, steeply subducting Tonga deep zone and a subhorizontally lying remnant of subducted lithosphere from the fossil Vityaz trench, respectively. Interpreting the deflections of the 660-km discontinuity in terms of local temperatures implies a thermal anomaly of −800$\,^{\circ}$K to −1200$\,^{\circ}$K at 660 km depth. Except for the southern region where it may thicken, the width of the depressed 660-km discontinuity region implies that the Tonga slab seems to penetrate the 660-km discontinuity with little deformation. Waveform modeling suggests that both the 410- and 660-km discontinuities are sharp. The 660-km discontinuity is at most 2 km thick in many parts of the region, and a first-order discontinuity cannot be precluded. The 410-km discontinuity thickness shows somewhat more variability and ranges from 2 to 10 km outside the slab and is at most 10 km thick within the slab. This suggests that the subduction process does not produce dramatic effects on the sharpness of the discontinuities.},

	Abstract = {A family of core-reflected shear waves generated by the 28 June 2002 Vladivostok deep earthquake, including near vertical reflections from the 410- and 660-km discontinuities, were recorded by ∼500 tiltmeters of the Hi-net and ∼60 broadband seismometers of the F-net in Japan. The observed upper mantle reflections were cross-correlated with synthetics calculated on the basis of the spectral element method for a fully three-dimensional Earth model using the Earth Simulator supercomputer to accurately determine the depths of the reflection points. The mapped upper mantle discontinuities were compared with a high-resolution P wave tomographic image. The 660-km discontinuity is depressed at a constant level of ∼15 km along the bottom of the horizontally extending aseismic slab under southwestern Japan. The transition from the normal to the depressed level occurs within a lateral distance of less than ∼200 km. Observations suggest that the reflections from the 410-km discontinuity interfere with those from slab-related structures on top of this discontinuity, leading to a spuriously large elevation of the 410-km discontinuity in and near the subducted slab. Records at stations relatively free from such interference effects, however, still imply elevation of this discontinuity within the slab.},

@article{Nakanishi1980,
	Abstract = {Longitudinally polarized precursors to ScS phases observed in the Shikoku and Chugoku districts, southwestern Japan, are interpreted as ScSp arrivals, resulting from ScSto-P conversions at a dipping interface in the upper mantle. An ScSp phase recorded in the Tohoku district, northeastern Japan, also is examined. The location of the conversion interface, beneath the Shikoku district, determined from the ScSp observations agrees with the upper boundary of the descending Philippine Sea plate inferred from the seismicity pattern of subcrustal earthquakes. It has been proposed on the basis of no seismic activity in the upper mantle that the leading edge of the downgoing Philippine Sea plate has not reached the upper mantle beneath the Chugoku district. The ScSp observations, however, present a possibility of the existence of an aseismic continuation of the Philippine Sea plate in the upper mantle beneath the Chugoku district. An alternative interpretation of the conversion interface may be possible. The interface inferred in the present study may correspond to a boundary between the asthenosphere and an aseismic dead slab which had descended from the Nankai trough at the previous cycle of plate convergence. This ScS-to-P conversion interface may be closely related to the late Quaternary volcanism in the Chugoku district. Low-velocity zones are required in the vicinity of the inclined ScS-to-P conversion interfaces in the upper mantle beneath southwestern and northeastern Japan in order to explain the observed relative polarity between the ScSp and ScS phases. The first-order discontinuity of the velocity contrast of about 6{\%}, which has been suggested between the lithosphere and overlying asthenosphere, cannot simultaneously explain all of the observed amplitudes, periods, and polarity of the ScSp phases. The simplest model which explains these observations is the low-velocity zone with the sharp upper and transitional lower boundaries. This low-velocity zone may be related to the melting or dehydration of the oceanic crust which has been subducted with the underlying lithospheric plate. The ScS-to-P conversion interface inferred beneath southwestern Japan is more transitional than that beneath northeastern Japan. This difference in nature of the conversion interfaces must correspond to the difference in geological histories of both the regions. A high dip angle of the Philippine Sea plate in the Kyushu district and a low dip angle for the Shikoku district suggest that the normal-faulting subcrustal earthquakes beneath the Bungo channel and Iyonada, the western part of the Sevo Inland Sea, can be explained in terms of tearing and hinge faulting at the junction of the two slabs with different dip angles.},

	Abstract = {ScSp phases are examined with special reference to their amplitude variations over seismograph networks in the Japanese Islands. ScSp of relatively large amplitude are observed along the Pacific side of the Japanese Islands. Amplitude ratios of the ScSp with respect to ScS are explained in terms of ScS-to-P conversion at the upper boundary of a descending Pacific plate which dips at about 30$\,^{\circ}$ and whose seismic wave velocity is between 5 and 10 per cent higher than that of the surrounding mantle. Large-amplitude ScSp are observed at stations nearest the Kurile or Japan trench. The amplitude ratios of ScSp/ScS are found to decrease rapidly with distance inland from the trench. An estimate is made of the effects of sharpness of the conversion interface, the incident angle of ScS upon it, and lateral variations of anelasticity within the asthenosphere overlying the descending Pacific plate, upon the ScSp/ScS ratios. We show that the sharpness of the conversion interface is the dominant factor. This result implies that the nature of the ScS-to-P conversion interface varies with distance from the trench or equivalently with depth. The presence of a low-velocity zone in the vicinity of the conversion interface is inferred from the relative polarity between ScSp and ScS observed at the stations on the outermost side of north-eastern Japan.ScSp arrivals from shallower conversions at depths less than about 80 km, observed in central and south-western Japan, are also examined to elucidate the structure of the Philippine Sea plate descending beneath this region. A discussion is made on the correlations between dipping subcrustal seismicity and the ScS-to-P conversion interfaces. Except for the Chugoku region, the ScS-to-P conversion interfaces correlate well with the dipping subcrustal seismicity. Our ScSp observations indicate the presence of a dipping discontinuity in the uppermost mantle beneath the Chugoku region, where no subcrustal earthquakes have been detected.},

	Abstract = {The reverberative interval of the seismogram, defined as the portion following the surface wave train propagating along the minor arc and ending with the first body wave arrivals from the major arc, provides an excellent window in which to observe subcritical reflections from mantle discontinuities. On an SH-polarized seismogram the intervals between ScSn and sScSn wave groups (zeroth-order reverberations) are approximately 15 min long and consist almost entirely of waves reflected one or more times from mantle discontinuities (first- and higher-order reverberations). We have developed signal enhancement and waveform inversion schemes to progressively extract information pertaining to mantle layering from the waveforms of zeroth- and first-order reverberations and have applied them to a data set of long-period digital seismograms drawn from a number of tectonic regions in and around the western Pacific. The results place important constraints on the nature of the transition zone discontinuities. Measurements of the two-way, vertical shear wave travel time from the free surface to the 400-km and 650-km discontinuities ($\tau$400 and $\tau$650 respectively) yield estimates of transition zone travel time, $\tau$TZ, largely uncontaminated by outside heterogeneity. Variations in the path-averaged estimates of $\tau$TZ are of the order of 5.4 s, indicating significant lateral heterogeneity in the transition zone. Correlations of $\tau$TZ with $\tau$400 and $\tau$LM (travel time through the lower mantle) are consistent with, but do not require, the thermal deflection of an exothermic phase transition near 400 km and an endothermic transition at 650 km, with ∼12 km of long-wavelength (500--5000 km) topography on each. The amount of topography estimated for the 650-km discontinuity is significantly less than predicted for a rigorously stratified mantle ({\textgreater}100 km). In a search for other mantle discontinuities, we find evidence for a strong reflector possibly associated with the onset of partial melting in the upper mantle (average depth of 86 km). Due to ambiguity inherent to the method, this feature can also be interpreted as an impedance increase in the D″ region of the lower mantle (70--170 km above the core-mantle boundary). No evidence is found for a 220-km discontinuity or the D″ discontinuity proposed by Lay and Helmberger (1983), suggesting that if such features are present in the western Pacific, they are either small (normal incidence, SH reflection coefficient R {\textless} 1.5{\%}) or intermittent or have lateral depth variations well in excess of 50 km.},

	Abstract = {A new P wave tomographic model of the mantle was constructed using more than 10 million travel times. The finite-frequency effect of seismic rays was taken into account by calculating banana-donut kernels at 2 Hz for all first arrival time data, and at 0.1 Hz for broadband differential travel time data. Based on this model, a systematic survey for subducted slab images was developed for the circum-Pacific; including the Kurile, Honshu, Izu-Bonin, Mariana, Java, Tonga-Kermadec, southern and northern South America, and Central America, arcs. This survey revealed a progressive lateral variation of the configuration of slabs along arc(s), which we interpret as an indication for successive stages of slab subduction through the Bullen's transition region with the 660 km discontinuity at the middle. We identified the four distinct stages: I - slab stagnant above the 660 km discontinuity; II - slab penetrating the 660 km discontinuity; III - slab trapped in the uppermost lower mantle (at a depth of 660--1000 km); and IV - slab descending well into the deep lower mantle. The majority of slab images are found to be either at Stage I or III, suggesting that Stages I and III are relatively stable or neutral and II and IV are relatively unstable or transient. There is a remarkable distinction for the deepest hypocentral distribution between slabs at Stage I and slabs at Stages II or III.},

However, few seismic waves are sensitive to the inner core and fundamental questions regarding the origin of the observed seismic features remain unanswered. Thus, new techniques to observe different types of inner core waves are imperative to improve data coverage. Here, we detail our method for detecting exotic inner core phases such as PKJKP and PKIIKP, using inner core compressional waves as proof of concept. We use phase weighted stacking on long period data from a global distribution of stations, and employ several synthetic methods, including normal mode summation and SPECFEM, to identify and confirm the inner core phases. We present evidence for two observations of exotic inner core compressional waves, and apply the technique to a previously detected inner core shear wave. A possible new inner core shear wave remains unconfirmed. Additionally, we show how our method is important for rejecting potential observations, and distinguishing between waves with similar traveltime and slowness. The method is most successful for detecting exotic inner core compressional waves, and will provide a new approach for studying the compressional wave structures in the upper inner core. },

@article{Blom2015,
	Abstract = {The structure of the Earth's inner core is not well known between depths of ∼100--200 km beneath the inner core boundary. This is a result of the PKP core phase triplication and the existence of strong precursors to PKP phases, which hinder the measurement of inner core compressional PKIKP waves at epicentral distances between roughly 143 and 148$\,^{\circ}$. Consequently, interpretation of the detailed structure of deeper regions also remains difficult. To overcome these issues we stack seismograms in slowness and time, separating the PKP and PKIKP phases which arrive simultaneously but with different slowness. We apply this method to study the inner core's Western hemisphere beneath South and Central America using paths travelling in the quasi-polar direction between 140 and 150$\,^{\circ}$ epicentral distance, which enables us to measure PKiKP--PKIKP differential traveltimes up to greater epicentral distance than has previously been done. The resulting PKiKP--PKIKP differential traveltime residuals increase with epicentral distance, which indicates a marked increase in seismic velocity for polar paths at depths greater than 100 km compared to reference model AK135. Assuming a homogeneous outer core, these findings can be explained by either (i) inner core heterogeneity due to an increase in isotropic velocity or (ii) increase in anisotropy over the studied depth range. Although this study only samples a small region of the inner core and the current data cannot distinguish between the two alternatives, we prefer the latter interpretation in the light of previous work.},

	Abstract = {This article identifies the likely origin of 1-Hz scattered waves in the vicinity of PKKP by comparing measurements of slowness and onset time to ray-theoretical predictions. The measurements are obtained from slant stacks of Large Aperture Seismic Array (LASA) data from 36 earthquakes and six explosions in the range 30$\,^{\circ}$--116$\,^{\circ}$. Three types of scattered waves explain the main features seen in the stacks, including: P scattered to PKP near the Earth's surface (P.PKP), PKKP scattered near its core--mantle--boundary (CMB) reflection point (PK.KP), and SKKP scattered near its CMB reflection point (SK.KP). The LASA stacks image the amplitude and slowness variations of the scattered waves with time. They also show where these waves can be detected and where they are free from contaminating arrivals. SK.KP waves rise above the noise approximately 100 sec before the onset time of the main SKKP arrival near 113$\,^{\circ}$. Observations of PK.KP span 30$\,^{\circ}$--100$\,^{\circ}$. However, at distances greater than 50$\,^{\circ}$ they suffer from P.PKP contamination. At distances less than 40$\,^{\circ}$ the PK.KP last for about 280 sec. This is approximately 130 sec longer than the maximum ray-theoretical prediction for waves scattered at the CMB, indicating a possible combination of near-surface scattering and contributions from the overlying mantle.},

	Abstract = {PKKP signals from Novaya Zemlya recorded at LASA at distances around 60$\,^{\circ}$ show consistent anomalies in both slowness and azimuth. The observed anomaly suggests that the signal is a BC branch arrival, although the arrival time corresponds to the DF branch. The BC branch, however, does not extend back to this distance. The azimuth of approach is in the range 229--245$\,^{\circ}$, instead of the expected 186$\,^{\circ}$. These anomalies are associated only with PKKP; analysis of the core phases PKiKP and P′P′ (BC) from the same events show that they arrived at LASA with the appropriate slownesses and azimuths. The PKKP signals can be interpreted as ``scattered'' PKKP; the scattering occurs on underside reflection at the core-mantle boundary and is probably caused by topographic irregularities on the boundary itself. The calculated scattering region has a surface projection at about 60$\,^{\circ}$S, 134$\,^{\circ}$E, which is outside the diametral plane through source and receiver, and about 21$\,^{\circ}$ from the expected PKKP reflection point at 76$\,^{\circ}$S, 95$\,^{\circ}$E. Both the ``direct'' and ``scattered'' arms of the PKKP signal have a PK path close to that of the ``C'' end of the BC branch. The unexpectedly large amplitude of the arrival suggests that there may be a focusing of energy at C, which would indicate a change in velocity gradient just above the inner core boundary. The observations nevertheless require, on the scattering interpretation, lateral variations in the topography of the core-mantle boundary and a region of relatively large topography responsible for the anomalous PKKP observations.},

	Abstract = {Detection of shallow slow earthquakes offers insight into the near-trench part of the subduction interface, an important region in the development of great earthquake ruptures and tsunami generation. Ocean-bottom monitoring of offshore seismicity off southern Kyushu, Japan, recorded a complete episode of low-frequency tremor, lasting for 1 month, that was associated with very-low-frequency earthquake (VLFE) activity in the shallow plate interface. The shallow tremor episode exhibited two migration modes reminiscent of deep tremor down-dip of the seismogenic zone in some other subduction zones: a large-scale slower propagation mode and a rapid reversal mode. These similarities in migration properties and the association with VLFEs strongly suggest that both the shallow and deep tremor and VLFE may be triggered by the migration of episodic slow slip events.},

	Abstract = {We document our tomographic method and present a new global model of three-dimensional (3-D) variations in mantle P wave velocity. The model is parameterized by means of rectangular cells in latitude, longitude, and radius, the size of which adapts to sampling density by short-period (1 Hz) data. The largest single data source is ISC/NEIC data reprocessed by Engdahl and coworkers, from which we use routinely picked, short-period P, Pg, Pn, pP, and pwP data (for earthquakes during the period 1964∼2007). To improve the resolution in the lowermost and uppermost mantle, we use differential times of core phases (PKPAB − PKPDF, PKPAB − PKPBC, Pdiff − PKPDF) and surface-reflected waves (PP-P). The low-frequency differential times (Pdiff, PP) are measured by waveform cross correlation. Approximate 3-D finite frequency kernels are used to integrate the long-period data (Pdiff, PP) and short-period (P, pP, PKP) data. This global data set is augmented with data from regional catalogs and temporary seismic arrays. A crust correction is implemented to mitigate crustal smearing into the upper mantle. We invert the data for 3-D variations in P wave speed and effects of hypocenter mislocation subject to norm and gradient regularization. Spatial resolution is ∼100 km in the best sampled upper mantle regions. Our model, which is available online and which will be updated periodically, reveals in unprecedented detail the rich variation in style of subduction of lithospheric slabs into the mantle. The images confirm the structural complexity of downwellings in the transition zone discussed in previous papers and show with more clarity the structure of slab fragments stagnant in the transition zone beneath east Asia. They also reveal low wave speed beneath major hot spots, such as Iceland, Afar, and Hawaii, but details of these structures are not well resolved by the data used.},

@article{Obara2006,
	Abstract = {Non-volcanic deep low-frequency tremors in southwest Japan exhibit a strong temporal and spatial correlation with slow slip detected by the dense seismic network. The tremor signal is characterized by a low-frequency vibration with a predominant frequency of 0.5--5 Hz without distinct P- or S-wave onset. The tremors are located using the coherent pattern of envelopes over many stations, and are estimated to occur near the transition zone on the plate boundary on the forearc side along the strike of the descending Philippine Sea plate. The belt-like distribution of tremors consists of many clusters. In western Shikoku, the major tremor activity has a recurrence interval of approximately six months, with each episode lasting over a week. The tremor source area migrates during each episode along the strike of the subducting plate with a migration velocity of about 10 km/day. Slow slip events occur contemporaneously with this tremor activity, with a coincident estimated source area that also migrates during each episode. The coupling of tremor and slow slip in western Shikoku is very similar to the episodic tremor and slip phenomenon reported for the Cascadia margin in northwest North America. The duration and recurrence interval of these episodes varies between tremor clusters even on the same subduction zone, attributable to regional difference in the frictional properties of the plate interface.},

	Abstract = {Episodes of nonvolcanic tremor and accompanying slow slip recently have been observed in the subduction zones of Japan and Cascadia. In Cascadia, such episodes typically last a few weeks and differ from "normal" earthquakes in their source location and moment-duration scaling. The three most recent episodes in the Puget Sound/southern Vancouver Island portion of the Cascadia subduction zone were exceptionally well recorded. In each episode, we saw clear pulsing of tremor activity with periods of 12.4 and 24 to 25 hours, the same as the principal lunar and lunisolar tides. This indicates that the small stresses associated with the solid-earth and ocean tides influence the genesis of tremor much more effectively than they do the genesis of normal earthquakes. Because the lithostatic stresses are 10(5) times larger than those associated with the tides, we argue that tremor occurs on very weak faults.},

	Abstract = {On October 6, 2000, an Mw = 6.7 crustal earthquake occurred in western Tottori prefecture, southwest Japan. Beneath the focal region of the earthquake, deep low-frequency (DLF) earthquakes were observed at depths of around 30 km. Five DLF earthquakes were detected within 3 years before the mainshock and more than 60 DLF earthquakes were observed during the 13 months after the mainshock. We investigated the focal mechanism of the DLF earthquake that occurred 9 hours before the mainshock, using amplitude ratios of the S-waves to the P-waves and polarization patterns of the S-waves. Both analyses indicated that a single-force source mechanism is more preferable than a double-couple source mechanism, which suggests the transport of fluid such as water or magma. This event is probably another example of DLF earthquakes that occur beneath active fault zones.},

	Abstract = {We report a ``slow thrust slip event'' that occurred beneath the Bungo Channel region, southwestern Japan. On Oct. and Dec., 1996, two Hyuganada earthquakes (both Mw = 6.7), followed by afterslips, occurred. In addition, a crustal movement characterized by an extremely slow rise was observed around the Bungo Channel, about 200 km north from the epicenters, and continued for about 300 days long. Assuming a slow slip on the plate boundary, we estimate its duration and surface displacements from GPS time series data by curve-fitting, and then, determine the fault slip distribution. We found that a slow slip without any earthquakes continued for nearly one year and released the seismic moment comparable to that of the Hyuganada earthquakes. Occurrence of the slow thrust slip event suggests that this kind of event may be a characteristic mode of stress release at a transition region of interplate coupling.},

Several lines of evidence indicate that the origin of these 10s waves must be around the Aso volcano, located in the central part of Kyushu Island, Japan. Although a 10s period is unusually long for a volcanic tremor and no corresponding surface activity at the crater was reported by the local observatory, the volcanic origin of the tremor is indisputable. A further astonishing aspects of the observation is that there exists a strong correlation between the onset of 10s waves observed remotely and cessation of high-frequency ({\textgreater}1Hz) volcanic tremors at the Aso volcano. The Aso volcano appears to be trembling with a 10s period without this having been noticed. Since seismic monitoring of volcanic activity is limited to high frequencies (above 1 Hz) at the most of the volcanoes in the world, long-period tremors of the type observed here might be a widespread phenomenon that has been overlooked.},

	Abstract = {The magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake of 28 June 1992 triggered a remarkably sudden and widespread increase in earthquake activity across much of the western United States. The triggered earthquakes, which occurred at distances up to 1250 kilometers (17 source dimensions) from the Landers mainshock, were confined to areas of persistent seismicity and strike-slip to normal faulting. Many of the triggered areas also are sites of geothermal and recent volcanic activity. Static stress changes calculated for elastic models of the earthquake appear to be too small to have caused the triggering. The most promising explanations involve nonlinear interactions between large dynamic strains accompanying seismic waves from the mainshock and crustal fluids (perhaps including crustal magma). },

In the summer of 1999, a cluster of seven sites briefly reversed their direction of motion. No seismicity was associated with this event. The sudden displacements are best explained by ∼2 centimeters of aseismic slip over a 50-kilometer-by-300-kilometer area on the subduction interface downdip from the seismogenic zone, a rupture equivalent to an earthquake of moment magnitude 6.7. This provides evidence that slip of the hotter, plastic part of the subduction interface, and hence stress loading of the megathrust earthquake zone, can occur in discrete pulses.},

	Abstract = {? Abstract?Recent developments in volcanic seismology include new techniques to improve earthquake locations that have changed clouds of earthquakes to lines (faults) for high-frequency events and small volumes for low-frequency (LF) events. Spatial mapping of the b-value shows regions of normal b and high b anomalies at depths of 3?4 and 7?10 km. Increases in b precede some eruptions. LF events and very-long-period (VLP) events have been recorded at many volcanoes, and models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Deep long-period (LP) events are fairly common, but may represent several processes. Acoustic sensors have greatly improved the study of volcanic explosions. Volcanic tremor is stronger for fissure eruptions, phreatic eruptions, and higher gas contents. Path and site effects can be extreme at volcanoes. Seismicity at volcanoes is triggered by large earthquakes, although mechanisms are still uncertain. A number of volcanoes have significant deformation with very little seismicity. Tomography has benefited from improved techniques and better instrumental arrays.},

	Abstract = {Oceanic plates subducted at trenches penetrate into the deep mantle, and encounter a structural boundary at a depth of 410 km where olivine, the dominant element of mantle rocks, transforms into a higher density form wadsleyite. This transformation may be delayed within the coldest core of subducting plates (slabs) due to kinetic effects, and it has been suggested that metastable olivine may persist deeper than 410 km. Using high density seismic array data in Japan, we show the direct image of the structure corresponding to this metastable olivine wedge (MOW) beneath southwest Japan. Numerical simulation of a subducting slab, including the kinetic effect of water (H2O) on the olivine--wadsleyite transformation, indicates that the presence of the imaged MOW requires an insignificant amount of water (less than 100 wt. ppm) be present in the slab mantle, thus a deep dry cold slab. We infer that the transportation of water into the deep mantle occurs along the top surface of the subducting slab, but no significant amount within the slab itself. We also demonstrate that a numerical simulation including the kinetics of 660-km phase transformation can reconcile the observed deep depression of the 660-km discontinuity with a gentle Clapeyron slope.},

Forward modelling using the reflectivity method is conducted to explain the variation of P-wave traveltimes as a function of epicentral distance near the core shadow zone. Additionally, PcP--P traveltimes are examined to enlarge the survey area. As a result, a rapid variation of P-wave velocity is detected at the base of the mantle. Regions of thin (20--50 km thick) and low velocity (−2 to −5 per cent) layers at the base of the mantle are intersected by an 80-km-thick region with a high velocity (+2 per cent). A slightly fast region exists at the northwest of the region with the thin low-velocity layer. These layers are typically separated by several hundred kilometres and would be difficult to explain by thermal effects alone. These observations suggest that very complicated thermochemical reactions occur near the edge of the Pacific LLSVP.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We used ambient noise data recorded by the NECESSArray, a portable seismic array deployed in Northeast China, to construct Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion curves and obtain phase velocity maps for periods from 6 to 40 s. S-wave velocity structure beneath NE China is obtained by joint inversion of the phase velocities and receiver functions. Our results show good correlation between crustal velocity structure and geological features. At shallow depths the Songliao Basin is separated into two small sub-basins by a fast velocity anomaly corresponding to a southwest uplifted horst and the southern sub-basin is associated with the Kailu depression. A low-velocity anomaly extending from the lower-crust to uppermost mantle beneath the Changbaishan mountain range is consistent with P- and S-wave tomography models. The mantle low velocity has been interpreted as a local mantle upwelling attributed to the subducting Pacific slab induced return flow. Finally, the S-wave velocity in the mid-and-lower crust is lower beneath the Xing'an--Mongolia Orogenic Belt (XMOB) than beneath the Changbaishan mountain range. This was not expected since the Changbaishan mountain range has experienced more extensive volcanic activity in the Cenozoic, including the currently active Changbaishan and Jingpohu volcanoes, than the XMOB. We infer that the mid-and-lower crust of the XMOB is mainly felsic in composition and propose that the low shear-wave velocity of the mid-and-lower crust beneath the XMOB could be the consequence of removal of deep mafic crust through a continental accretion and subsequent delamination event in the Paleozoic, or via convection removal induced by the rollback of the flat subducted Paleo-Pacific slab during the middle Mesozoic.},

Using the reverse two-station/event method with 11 642 Lg path-amplitudes from 78 crustal earthquakes, we obtain a 2-D tomographic image of Lg Qo with values ranging from ∼50 to 1400. A high degree of detail in the lateral variation of Lg attenuation is revealed in our tomographic image. High Qo regions are found in the Great Xing'an, Lesser Xing'an and Songen-Zhangguangcai Ranges. Low Qo regions are observed in the Songliao, Sanjiang and Erlian Basins. The lowest Qo is found near the Wudalianchi volcanic field and other Quaternary volcanic fields, the southern Songliao Basin, the western edge of the Erlian Basin and the Sanjiang Basin. Low Qo values are measured for paths that cross sedimentary basins with thick, unconsolidated sediments. Most of the high Lg attenuation in the Songliao Basin correlates reasonably well with low crustal Rayleigh wave phase velocity anomalies. The highest attenuating regions also correlate well with regions of Holocene volcanism.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In order to better understand the deep subduction geometry of the Pacific plate and genesis of intraplate volcanism in northeast China (NE China), we computed a total of 45,505 receiver functions from 788 teleseismic events recorded by 255 stations (NECESSArray temporal and permanent stations) in NE China. We used a common-conversion-point stacking (CCP) method to generate a 3D reflectivity volume beneath the study area. To position the P-to-S conversions to the correct depths, we employed 3D crustal and mantle models as references to make time to depth conversion. The 3D reflectivity volume was generated in an area between 115$\,^{\circ}$--135$\,^{\circ}$E and 40$\,^{\circ}$--49$\,^{\circ}$N, in the depth range of 300 to 800 km. We found significant topographic relief on the 660-km discontinuity across the study area. In particular, in a westward Pacific plate subduction section between 40$\,^{\circ}$N and ∼45.5$\,^{\circ}$N, the 660-km discontinuity is depressed by as much as ∼30--40 km along the western extension of the deep seismicity. The depression is elongated along the strike of the deep seismicity and is confined to a 200--300 km region in the E--W direction of subduction. To the west of this depression the 660-km discontinuity is uplifted by 5--10 km in a rectangular area of ∼100 km by 200 km centered at about 125$\,^{\circ}$E and 43$\,^{\circ}$N. In the north, the 660-km discontinuity is moderately depressed (∼20 km) in a broad area that extends further west. The high and low regions in the 660-km topographic map correlate, respectively, with low- and high-velocity anomalies in the P- and S-wave tomographic velocity images at the same depth. Our results suggest that slab stagnation might not be occurring in the southern part of the NE China, where the Changbaishan volcanic complex is located, thus the magmatism is unlikely caused by dehydration of the flat-lying Pacific slab in the transition zone. The low velocity mantle upwelling arising from a gap of stagnant slabs is a likely source that feeds the volcanic complex in NE China.},

	Abstract = {The oceanic asthenosphere is characterized as a low viscosity channel down to 200--300 km depth separating the cold lithosphere from above, and it is intimately linked to a layer of low seismic velocity and prominent seismic anisotropy observed globally beneath ocean basins. While subduction of tectonic plates in convergent margins is well recognized, the fate of oceanic asthenosphere remains enigmatic. We demonstrate that subduction of the oceanic asthenosphere characterized by weak azimuthal anisotropy and strong radial anisotropy explains the essence of sub-slab shear-wave splitting patterns, where the fast splitting direction changes from predominantly trench-parallel (or sub-parallel) under relatively steep subduction zones to frequently trench-normal under shallow subduction zones. To explain the observed splitting time, the thickness of the subducted asthenosphere is estimated to be 100 $\pm$ 50 km.},

@article{Song2013,
	Abstract = {Song and Kawakatsu (2012) have shown that the sub-slab fast splitting pattern observed in most subduction zones can be a direct consequence of subduction of the oceanic asthenosphere that has strong radial anisotropy. This model not only explains the non-intuitive trench-parallel splitting pattern in most of subduction zones, but also predicts the trench-normal behavior (fast polarization direction sub-parallel to the absolute plate motion of the incoming plate) observed in several shallow subduction zones. The general validity of such a scenario is crucial to fundamental understandings of the development of mantle anisotropy in sub-lithosphere or/and sub-slab conditions, the nature and formation of oceanic asthenosphere as well as the flow pattern and mass transport near subduction zones. To validate this scenario, we examine SKS splitting patterns observed across the fore-arc in central Alaska. Here the fast splitting direction varies from plate motion sub-parallel near the trench to mostly trench-parallel beyond the 100 km slab-isodepth contour, while being strongly variable in between. After taking into account the rotation of anisotropy symmetry in the oceanic asthenosphere with respect to the local plate motion obliquity and down-dip variations in the slab dip, we reproduce a general 90-degree switch in fast splitting direction as well as the back azimuth dependent splitting pattern across the entire fore-arc. The current validation further augments the idea that, apart from anisotropy in the mantle wedge and the subducting slab, subduction of the oceanic asthenosphere is likely to be the dominant source of seismic anisotropy in central Alaska and potentially in many subduction zones. Furthermore, this result also provides alternative views to models of seismic anisotropy in the mantle wedge and on the length scale in which the 3D mantle flow may be important.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We have collected a global dataset of several thousands of high quality records of PKPdf, PKPbc, PKPbc-diff and PKPab phase arrivals in the distance range [149--178$\,^{\circ}$]. Within this collection, we have identified an energy packet that arrives 5--20 s after the PKPbc (or PKPbc-diff) and represents a phase that is not predicted by 1D reference seismic models. We use array analysis techniques to enhance the signal of these scattered phases and show that they originate along the great-circle path in a consistent range of arrival times and narrow range of ray parameters. We therefore refer to this scattered energy the ``M'' phase. Using the cross-correlation technique to detect and measure the scattered energy arrival times, we compiled a dataset of 1116 records of this M phase. There are no obvious variations with source or station location, nor with the depth of the source. After exploration of possible location for this M phase, we show that its origin is most likely in the vicinity of the inner-core boundary. A tentative model is found that predicts an M-like phase, and produces good fits to its travel times as well as those of the main core phases. In this model, the P velocity profile with depth exhibits an increased gradient from about 400 km to 50 km above the ICB (i.e. slightly faster velocities than in AK135 or PREM), and a ∼ 50 km thick lower velocity layer right above the ICB.},

	Abstract = {We systematically searched for seismograms of waves diffracted around the inner core (PKPCdiff) from all the temporary seismic arrays with data currently available at the IRIS DMC, as well as some permanent regional seismic arrays including F-NET in Japan and GRF in Germany, to assemble the largest high-quality PKPCdiff database ever created. PKPCdiff waves preferentially sample the base of the outer core and so contain important clues about Earth structure in this region. We measured PKPDF--PKPCdiff differential traveltimes and PKPCdiff/PKPDF amplitude ratios in the distance range of 154$\,^{\circ}$--160$\,^{\circ}$ and modeled the observations using grid searches and full wave theory synthetic seismograms. The optimum model found by fitting the differential traveltimes has relatively low velocity at the base of the outer core as in AK135, which is consistent with many previous traveltime studies. However, the optimum model found by fitting the amplitude ratios (PKPCdiff/PKPDF) does not exhibit this feature, and instead is closer to PREM. The discrepancy may be explained by two likely causes. One is that small-scale topography or roughness on the ICB tends to scatter energy away from PKPCdiff waves by generating trailing coda waves. The other is that there exists a thin layer with relatively low Q at the base of the outer core. This might be expected if there are suspended solid particles at the base of the outer core, as proposed decades ago. Both mechanisms could generate smaller PKPCdiff amplitudes without significantly affecting PKPCdiff traveltimes.},

	Abstract = {A number of deep earthquakes from the Fiji-Tonga region were used to study the properties of the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The investigation was restricted to an area with a diameter of only a few hundred kilometers at the CMB, the use of a cluster of neighboring events yielding redundant sampling and rather good resolution. The components of the investigation are: (i) a classical stacking procedure to search for additional reflectors near the CMB; (ii) a deconvolution of seismograms and a stack of the inferred reflector series for the same purpose; (iii) a matched filter method to determine PcP travel times and PcP/P amplitude ratios precisely; and (iv) a comparison with synthetic seismograms to check the consistency of derived travel-time residuals and PcP amplitude variations in the presence of CMB topography. While we do not see any additional reflector for epicentral distances around 35$\,^{\circ}$, we detect by stacking seismograms recorded at 70$\,^{\circ}$ an additional phase which might be caused by a reflection from the top of D″. We show that PcP travel-time residuals must not be interpreted as being caused exclusively by CMB topography. An additional investigation of synthetics provides some constraints on dominant wavelengths and corresponding amplitudes of CMB undulations. For wavelengths of 50--400 km the elevation cannot exceed 2--3 km, if PcP is observed in this particular area.},

Such additional arrivals are generated by the interaction of ScP with structure at the reflection and conversion point at or near the CMB. We show precursors and postcursors to ScP, indicating an ultralow-velocity zone (ULVZ) at the CMB in the region between Tonga-Fiji and Australia. One-dimensional forward modeling of the short-period data leads to models of the ULVZ with thickness varying between 5 and 20 km, velocity reductions of 0--10{\%} and 10--30{\%} for P velocity and S velocity, respectively, and 0--50{\%} density increase. Many events, however, show simple waveforms, consistent with a locally simple CMB. Models for proximal events can vary greatly, indicating very complex, three-dimensional structure with scale lengths of a few tens of kilometers. These results point to complex chemical and physical processes in the lowermost mantle.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A layer of reduced P-velocity gradient with thickness of about 100--200 km has been identified at the base of the liquid core from seismological methods. It has been interpreted as a dense layer resulting from partial re-melting of the inner core, which is depleted in light elements with respect to the liquid core during freezing. In an attempt to specify where freezing and re-melting occur, the structure of this basal layer is investigated with the seismological core phase PKPbc which has its turning point in the lower third of the outer core. The large PKPbc data set of the EHB catalog distributed by the International Seismological Centre is analyzed. In order to compensate for the uneven distribution of the data and to minimize the influence of mantle heterogeneities, the travel time anomalies are binned inside equal area and equal azimuth sectors sampling the base of the liquid core at different depths. Most of the observed variations in the binned travel time residuals are not significant according to their confidence level. The only features which could be significant are a large patch with a velocity increase of about 0.5{\%} located at the top of the basal layer beneath the eastern hemisphere, and the complementary velocity decrease beneath the western hemisphere and the South pole. This observation suggests that some freezing or re-melting processes occur at the top of the basal layer with a hemispherical dissymmetry. If confirmed, it may give strong constraints on the fate of the light elements during the freezing and re-melting process and on their interaction with the basal layer and the overlying liquid core.},

	Abstract = {Well separated individual PKP precursors observed at the Yellowknife seismic array (YK) for a high quality doublet of earthquakes provide an opportunity to study the location of the corresponding scatterers and assess the stability of the location estimation. Based on the comparison of the waveforms of stacked individual precursors and those of PKIKP phases, we are able to determine that most of these precursors originate from scattering of the PKPbc (rather than the PKPab) branch above the B caustic on the receiver side. This allows a reliable location of the scatterers in the lower mantle. Their depths range from 2890 km (the CMB) to 2270 km, scattering angles range from 45.8$\,^{\circ}$ to 16.0$\,^{\circ}$, and surface projections range from southern Ontario to northern Saskatchewan in Canada. These locations are associated with transitions from slow to fast velocities in mantle tomographic models and follow the expected general dip direction of fossil slabs under north America. This suggests that the subducted slab remnants under north America have retained their compositional signature. The fact that we can essentially treat these scatterers as reflections from plane boundaries suggests that the remnant fragments of slab may be spatially extended, which should be confirmed using broadband data. Average differences in measured slowness and back-azimuth of the doublet precursors are as small as 0.08 s/deg and 1.4 deg, respectively. Our study indicates that it may be possible to locate such scatterers using single earthquakes and small aperture seismic arrays.},

	Abstract = {Summary We use PcP (the core reflected P phase) recordings of deep earthquakes and nuclear explosions from the Gr{\"{a}}fenberg (Germany) and NORSAR (Norway) arrays to investigate the core--mantle boundary region beneath Europe and western Eurasia. We find evidence for a previously unknown ultra-low velocity zone 600 km south-east of Moscow, located at the edge of a middle-size low shear- velocity region imaged in seismic tomography that is located beneath the Volga river region. The observed amplitude variations of PcP can be modelled by velocity reductions of P and S-waves of −5{\%} and −15{\%}, respectively, with a density increase of +15{\%}. Travel time delays of pre-and postcursors are indicating a thickness of about 13 km for this ultra-low velocity region (ULVZ). However, our modelling also reveals highly ambiguous amplitude variations of PcP and a reflection off the top of the anomaly for various ULVZs and topography models. Accordingly, large velocity contrasts of up to −10{\%} in VP and −20{\%} in VS cannot be excluded. In general, the whole Volga river region shows a complex pattern of PcP amplitudes caused most likely by CMB undulations. Further PcP probes beneath Paris, Kiev and northern Italy indicate likely normal CMB conditions, whereas the samples below Finland and the Hungary--Slovakia border yield strongly amplified PcP signals suggesting strong CMB topography effects. We evaluate the amplitude behaviour of PcP as a function of distance and several ULVZ models using the 1D reflectivity and the 2D Gauss beam method. The influence of the velocity and density perturbations is analysed as well as the anomaly thickness, the dominant period of the source wavelet and interface topographies. Strong variation of the PcP amplitude are obtained as a function of distance and of the impedance contrast. We also consider two types of topographies: undulations atop the CMB in the presence of flat ULVZs and vice versa. Where a broad range of CMB topography dimensions lead to large PcP amplitude variations, only large ULVZ undulations generate significant amplitude scattering. Consequently, this indicates that topography effects of anomalies may mask the true medium parameters as well as the ULVZ thickness. Moreover, there might be a possibility of misinterpreting the precursor as PcP, in particular for thin ULVZs.},

@article{Tackley2012,
	Abstract = {The core--mantle boundary (CMB) -- the interface between the silicate mantle and liquid iron alloy outer core -- is the most important boundary inside our planet, with processes occurring in the deep mantle above it playing a major role in the evolution of both the core and the mantle. The last decade has seen an astonishing improvement in our knowledge of this region due to improvements in seismological data and techniques for mapping both large- and small-scale structures, mineral physics discoveries such as post-perovskite and the iron spin transition, and dynamical modelling. The deep mantle is increasingly revealed as a very complex region characterised by large variations in temperature and composition, phase changes, melting (possibly at present and certainly in the past), and anisotropic structures. Here, some fundamentals of the relevant processes and uncertainties are reviewed in the context of long-term Earth evolution and how it has led to the observed present-day structures. Melting has been a dominant process in Earth's evolution. Several processes involving melting, some of which operated soon after Earth's formation and some of which operated throughout its history, have produced dense, iron rich material that has likely sunk to the deepest mantle to be incorporated into a heterogeneous basal m{\'{e}}lange (BAM) that is now evident seismically as two large low-velocity regions under African and the Pacific, but was probably much larger in the past. This BAM modulates core heat flux, plume formation and the separation of different slab components, and may contain various trace-element cocktails required to explain geochemical observations. The geographical location of BAM material has, however, probably changed through Earth's history due to the inherent time-dependence of plate tectonics and continental cycles.},

	Abstract = {Some regions of the Earth's lowermost mantle exhibit anomalous seismic properties within a thin zone, less than tens of kilometers in thickness, that directly overlies the core-mantle boundary (CMB). These regions have been dubbed Ultra-Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs) due to their greater than 10{\%} drop in seismic velocities. High resolution seismic array studies have found small, localized ULVZs (e.g., 10 km thick and 50-100 km wide) with a large increase in ULVZ density ({\~{}} 10{\%}) relative to the background mantle. Many studies note that ULVZ material may be chemically distinct, though P-to-S-wave velocity reductions are sometimes consistent with partial melting. The apparent absence of ULVZs in many regions of the CMB is consistent with having a distinct chemical signature, regardless of melt content. However, it is unknown how a small volume of very dense ULVZ material can be locally elevated, particularly in the presence of large-scale compositional reservoirs predicted by seismology, geochemistry, and geodynamics. We perform ultra-high resolution, kilometer-scale, thermochemical convection calculations for an entire mantle system containing three distinct compositional components in order to investigate how a ULVZ interacts with large-scale lower mantle compositional reservoirs. We demonstrate that convection can dynamically support small scale accumulations of dense ULVZ material, consistent with the size and density inferred from seismology. Furthermore, we show that ULVZs preferentially reside at the boundaries of large compositional reservoirs, which periodically break apart and merge together in response to changes in downwelling patterns. As they do, ULVZ material migrates and recollects in a systematic fashion. ULVZ material can become entrained in mantle plumes forming from reservoir boundaries, contributing to isotopic anomalies found in hotspot volcanism. Thus ULVZ detection helps to constrain large-scale mantle convection patterns, the locations of compositional reservoir boundaries, and the evolution of geochemical reservoirs.},

	Abstract = {A multi-phase analysis using long-period World Wide Standardized Seismograph Network and Canadian Network data has been conducted using core-phases for deep focus events from the southwest Pacific. These include SKS, S2KS, SVdiff, and SPdKS. The last phase emerges from SKS near 106$\,^{\circ}$ and is associated with a P-wave diffracting along the bottom of the mantle. Patterns in S2KS - SKS differential travel times (TS2KS - SKS) correlate with those in SPdKS - SKS (TSPdKS - SKS). TS2KS - SKS values strongly depend on variations in VS structure in the lower third of the mantle, whereas TSPdKS - SKS values mainly depend on VP structure and variations in a thin zone (100 km or less) at the very base of the mantle. Anomalously large TS2KS - SKS and TSPdKS - SKS values (relative to the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM)) are present for Fiji-Tonga and Kermadec events (recorded in North and South America), along with anomalously large SVdiff amplitudes well into the core's shadow. More northerly paths beneath the Pacific to North America for Indonesian and Solomon events display both PREM-like and anomalous times. A model compatible with the observations is presented, and contains a thin very-low-velocity layer at the base of the mantle that underlies the large volumetric lower-mantle low-velocity regions in the southwest Pacific. A low-velocity layer of 20--100 km thickness with reductions of up to 5--10{\%} (relative to PREM) can reproduce TSPdKS - SKS as well as SVdiff amplitudes. Large-scale (more than 1000 km) lower-mantle VS heterogeneity (2--4{\%}) can explain long-wavelength trends in TS2KS - SKS. The exact thickness and velocity reduction in the basal layer is uncertain, owing to difficulties in resolving whether anomalous structure occurs on the source- and/or receiver-side of wavepaths (at the CMB).},

This layer is detected beneath a tomographically resolved large-scale low velocity feature in the lower mantle beneath the central-Pacific.

The PcP-to-P amplitude ratios for these events show large variability with some amplitude ratios more than an order of magnitude larger than predicted by radial Earth models such as IASP91 or PREM. The amplitude ratios vary laterally with PcP core-mantle boundary reflection points showing a ∼1$\,^{\circ}$ region with exceptionally large amplitude ratios. It is likely that the variability in relative PcP amplitudes is due in large part to CMB topography.

This data set is an order of magnitude larger than used for S20RTS and includes new data types. The data are related to shear-velocity perturbations from the (anisotropic) PREM model via kernel functions and ray paths that are computed using PREM. Contributions to phase delays and traveltimes from the heterogeneous crust are estimated using model CRUST2.0. We calculate crustal traveltimes from long-period synthetic waveforms rather than using ray theory. Shear-velocity perturbations are parametrized by spherical harmonics up to degree 40 and by 21 vertical spline functions for a total of 35 301 degrees of freedom. S40RTS is characterised by 8000 resolved unknowns. Since we compute the exact inverse, it is straightforward to determine models associated with fewer or more unknowns by adjusting the model damping. S40RTS shares many characteristics with S20RTS because it is based on the same data types and similar modelling procedures. However, S40RTS shows more clearly than S20RTS the abrupt change in the pattern of shear-velocity heterogeneity across the 660-km phase transition and it presents a more complex patern of shear-velocity heterogeneity in the lower mantle. Utilities to visualise S40RTS and software to analyse the resolution of S40RTS (or models for different damping parameters) are made available. },

	Abstract = {Variability of core-mantle boundary (CMB) structure is imaged at the kilometer to tens of kilometers scale by intensive waveform modeling of the ScP phase. Recordings of earthquakes in the Tonga-Fiji subduction zone from the small-aperture (10 km), high-frequency (∼2--4 Hz) Alice Springs Array in central Australia are used to document anomalous ScP waveform variations due to the presence of an ultralow-velocity zone (ULVZ) at the CMB. These data expand coverage from previous results using the Warramunga Array, which is located slightly to the north, and indicate the existence of a geographically confined ULVZ at the CMB, roughly 100 km in lateral extent, south of New Caledonia and east of Australia. Synthetic modeling indicates seismic velocity reductions of ∼8{\%} and ∼24{\%} for P wave and S waves, respectively, and a well-constrained density increase of ∼10{\%} in a ∼8.5 km thick layer above the CMB. This ULVZ patch is well explained by an elevated iron content of partially molten mantle material, likely present as divalent oxidized iron in the low spin state: The properties of such an iron-enriched assemblage are consistent with both an elevated density and bulk modulus of this region, as are dictated from our best fit seismic results. Furthermore, a positive velocity gradient within the ULVZ may be present, which need not be associated with a decrease in melt content within this region but could rather be associated with a shift in the textural distribution of melt within the ULVZ.},

	Abstract = {A large, high quality P-wave data set comprising short-period and broadband signals sampling four separate regions in the lowermost mantle beneath the Cocos plate, Mexico, the central Pacific, and the north Pacific is analyzed using regional one-dimensional double-array stacking and modelling with reflectivity synthetics. A data-screening criterion retains only events with stable PcP energy in the final data stacks used for modelling and interpretation. This significantly improves the signal stacks relative to including unscreened observations, allows confident alignment on the PcP arrival and allows tight bounds to be placed on P-wave velocity structure above the core--mantle boundary (CMB). The PcP reflections under the Cocos plate are well modelled without any ultra-low velocity zone from 5 to 20$\,^{\circ}$N. At latitudes from 15 to 20$\,^{\circ}$N, we find evidence for two P-wave velocity discontinuities in the D″ region. The first is ∼182 km above the CMB with a $\delta$ln Vp of +1.5{\%}, near the same depth as a weaker discontinuity ({\textless}+0.5{\%}) observed from 5 to 15$\,^{\circ}$N in prior work. The other reflector is ∼454 km above the CMB, with a $\delta$ln Vp of +0.4{\%}; this appears to be a shallower continuation of the joint P- and S-wave discontinuity previously detected south of 15$\,^{\circ}$ N, which is presumed to be the perovskite to post-perovskite phase transition. The data stacks for paths bottoming below Mexico have PcP images that are well matched with the simple IASP91 structure, contradicting previous inferences of ULVZ presence in this region. These particular data are not very sensitive to any D″ discontinuities, and simply bound them to be {\textless}∼2{\%}, if present. Data sampling the lowermost mantle beneath the central Pacific confirm the presence of a ∼15-km thick ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ) just above the CMB, with $\delta$ln Vp and $\delta$ln Vs of around −3 to −4{\%} and −4 to −8{\%}, respectively. The ULVZ models predict previous S-wave data stacks well. The data for this region indicate laterally varying Vp discontinuities in D″, with one subregion having a $\delta$ln Vp of 0.5{\%} 140 km above the CMB. Beneath the north Pacific, the PcP arrivals are compatible with only weak ULVZ ($\delta$ln Vp ∼ 0 to −3{\%}), and there is a weak D″ reflector with $\delta$ln Vp = 0.5{\%}, near 314 km above the CMB. These results indicate localized occurrence of detectable ULVZ structures rather than ubiquitous ULVZ structure and emphasize the distinctiveness between the large low shear velocity province under the central Pacific and circum-Pacific regions.},

	Abstract = {Using an unusually large earthquake near the big island of Hawaii, we study the core mantle boundary (CMB) beneath the north-northeastern Pacific between Hawaii and North America. A dense sampling of the CMB is achieved using the core-reflected phase PcP recorded at a large number of high-quality stations in North America, including networks in California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, as well as at EarthScope's USArray stations. We apply an adaptive stacking technique for optimal record alignment on specific phases (namely P and PcP) and subsequently stack seismograms to obtain summation traces possessing relatively high signal-to-noise ratios of PcP and P. Anomalous ultralow-velocity zone (ULVZ) layering at the CMB has been noted to exist in various parts of the Pacific beneath the lowermost mantle large low shear velocity province imaged by tomography. ULVZ structure produces anomalous PcP waveform variations in the form of precursors to PcP. These PcP data, however, lack precursory energy, indicating either that (1) ULVZ layering is lacking or (2) that a ULVZ is present and thinner than our detection threshold, i.e., less than a few kilometers thick. We use synthetic waveform modeling to establish the sensitivity and utility of investigating the time window ahead of PcP for precursors generated from fine-scale CMB layering. These results, combined with evidence for ULVZ structure in other parts of the Pacific, suggest that ULVZs are intermittent and possibly only detectable in regions where mantle currents collect ULVZ material, whether or not partially molten, presumably beneath (or near) upwellings or plumes.},

	Abstract = {The Earth's core--mantle boundary (CMB) marks the boundary between the hot, molten iron core and the silicate mantle and is a thermal, chemical, and flow boundary. Previous observations of very slow compressional wavespeeds suggest that thin ultra-low-velocity zones (ULVZs), possibly composed of a mixture of molten iron and silicates, exist at the base of the mantle. A molten or partially molten layer would cause a large shear wavespeed decrease; however this velocity drop has not been observed. Here, we use core reflected ScP phases to investigate the shear properties of ULVZs. These phases reveal at least two distinct regions: one region under Central America which is distinctly average (PREM and iasp91-like) and a second region under the entire Gulf of Alaska that produces large ScP reflections with amplitudes of up to 30 times larger than calculated with average Earth models. The large amplitudes suggest a combination of focusing by CMB topography, high shear wavespeeds at the bottom of the mantle, and low attenuation (high Q) along the ScP path; high shear wavespeeds and low attenuation are opposite from what would be expected from a shear wave ULVZ. A ULVZ in compressional wavespeeds (ultra-low Vp) has previously been observed in this region; however, in addition to the large amplitudes, the short-period ScP waveforms show no complexity that can be related to a ULVZ. Thus, either there is not a ULVZ under the Gulf of Alaska or, if it does exist, it is restricted to compressional wavespeed changes, precluding interpretation as partial melt but rather suggesting a chemical origin.},

In the Fiji data a secondary phase arriving 2 to 4 s after the direct P is identified as a precursor to PcP. This phase provides good evidence for a reflection off the top of a thin low-velocity layer above the CMB. Comparisons to synthetic seismograms indicate a layer thickness of 10 km and a velocity reduction of 5{\%}--10{\%} compared to the overlying mantle. A record section from an Argentina event does not show the PcP precursor, indicating that the low-velocity layer is not a global feature. This thin low-velocity layer is in the same place as a much larger S wave velocity anomaly in the lower mantle and is probably indicative of a boundary layer just above the CMB under the mid-Pacific.},

We show how both types of observations can be explained by a layer of silicate sediments, which accumulate at the top of the core as Earth cools. Compaction of the sediments expels most of the liquid iron but leaves behind a small amount of core material, which is entrained in mantle convection and may account for the isotopic signatures of core material in some hot spot plumes. Extraction of light elements from the liquid core also enhances the vigor of convection in the core and may increase the power available to the geodynamo.},

	Abstract = {Short-period teleseismic recordings of ScP from events in the Tonga-Fiji (TF) and Marianas (MAR) subduction complexes made by the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory seismograph network are examined for evidence of pre- and post-ScP phases. Such arrivals would be caused by interaction of ScP with ultralow-velocity zone (ULVZ) structures at the base of the mantle and can therefore be used to constrain the properties and occurrence of ULVZs. The relative timings and amplitudes of ScP, two pre-ScP phases, and one post-ScP phase potentially provide very good constraints on ULVZ compressional and shear velocities, density, and thickness. For example, the amplitude of the topside S to P conversion, SdP, is very strongly density contrast dependent, while the amplitude of the last arriving ScsP, a core reflection that converts to P upon emergence from the ULVZ, is very strongly dependent on the shear velocity contrast. Previous data, largely consisting of diffracted SPdiffKS arrivals and reflected PcP precursors, have been unable to provide good constraints on these two properties. In our data set, though, we find very little evidence for pre- and post-ScP arrivals, even for TF paths where abundant evidence for the presence of ULVZ exists. For the TF data distance range (43$\,^{\circ}$--48$\,^{\circ}$), precursor amplitudes are at or below the data noise level if the density contrast, $\delta$ln$\rho$, is {\textless}10{\%}, even for compressional velocity decreases of 10{\%}. The one definitive ScsP observation for the TF data is best modeled by a layer 20 km thick with 9 and 27{\%} $\upsilon$P and $\upsilon$S decreases, respectively, and a density increase ≤5{\%}. The absence of ScsP in the remainder of the TF data may be caused either by patchy ULVZ occurrence or by vertical transition zones between mantle and ULVZ {\textgreater} 10 km thick which lower ScsP amplitudes below detectable levels. Taken together, these properties favor ULVZ material composed dominantly of partial melt, but a contribution from core-mantle reaction products cannot be ruled out. For the MAR distance range (55$\,^{\circ}$--58$\,^{\circ}$), pre- and post-ScP arrival amplitudes are predicted to be higher, although such arrivals are absent from the MAR recordings. However, the quality of our data is not sufficiently good to rule out the presence of thinner and/or more subdued ULVZ in that region.},

Layer thickness is correlated with travel time residuals of the seismic phases that are most sensitive to the lowermost mantle velocity. These observations suggest that the layer is thinned beneath downwellings but is present everywhere along the core-mantle boundary.

@article{Revenaugh1991,
	Abstract = {This is the third paper in a four-part sequence that examines the nature of mantle layering using the multiple-ScS phases and internal reflections observed within the reverberative interval of SH-polarized seismograms. In this paper, migration techniques are applied to ScS reverberations to image discontinuities in shear impedance beneath a tectonically diverse study area that includes the western Pacific, Japan, the Philippine Sea, and Australasia. Between the M and 410-km discontinuities (Bullen's region B), the analysis reveals four reflectors, designated H, G, L, and X. The H (Hales) reflector is a positive impedance increase occurring at an average depth of about 60 km with a mean reflection coefficient of about 3.5{\%}. It can be seen on all profiles except those where its signature is overwhelmed by the G discontinuity and is best explained as the seismic expression of the spinel → garnet facies boundary. The G (Gutenberg) reflector, marking the lid-to-low-velocity zone (LVZ) interface, is the only negative impedance contrast identified from ScS reverberations anywhere in the mantle. It is observed along most of the oceanic paths sampled in our study, where its depth generally correlates with QScS but it is not found on any of the profiles from predominantly continental corridors, consistent with the notion that the LVZ is absent or only weakly expressed beneath the cratons. G occurs at a depth of ∼60 km beneath the western Pacific, shallower than most estimates of thermal boundary layer (plate) thickness; the data are consistent with a sharp drop in shear velocity owing to the breakdown of hydrous phases such as amphibole along a steeply rising portion of the geotherm within the thermal boundary layer. The G contrasts with the largest magnitude (up to 10{\%}) occur on profiles for back arc regions, where upper mantle melting may be accentuated by volatiles fluxing from subducted oceanic lithosphere. None of the eight profiles having a G discontinuity show an L reflector, or Lehmann discontinuity, whereas most of the ones that lack G require an L of substantial magnitude (R0(ZL) ≈ 0.02). This positive impedance contrast is not a global feature but has a continental affinity within the study area, increasing from an average depth of about 210 km beneath the continental margin north of Australia to nearly 300 km near the center of the western Australian craton. As other investigators have noted, this discontinuity is not easily explained by plausible phase transitions or chemical changes. We propose that the L reflector represents a transition from an anisotropic mechanical boundary layer to an annealed, nearly isotropic asthenosphere within the continental tectosphere. The substantial differences between the reflectivity structures of continents and oceans documented in this study thus provide new evidence for the thick plate model of the continents. The X reflector is an enigmatic feature observed at a depth near 300 km on profiles sampling regions of active subduction. Like L, this impedance increase has been observed in refraction studies but is not readily explained by standard mantle models. Based on its limited geographic occurrence, we speculatively ascribe the X discontinuity to hydration reactions occurring in parts of the mantle that have been volatile charged by subducting lithosphere. Overall, our results indicate an upper mantle where impedance layering varies substantially over a broad spectrum of scale lengths, but correlates with surface geology and plate structure down to at least 250 km (the L discontinuity), and perhaps to depths as great as 350 km (the X discontinuity). The lateral variability observed in region B reflectivity structure appears to be governed primarily by the thermal and chemical gradients related to continental deep structure and subduction. The large magnitude of this variability explains why no consistent view of upper mantle structure has developed from global data sets, which tend to average out the region B features observed by ScS reverberations.},

In addition, a dense deployment (4-km spacing) of stations within the German Depth Profiling of Tibet and the Himalayas (GEDEPTH) project also recorded a number of teleseismic earthquakes. The third data source used in this study is the records of the permanent broadband station at Lhasa. Teleseismic records have been obtained in sufficient quantity and quality to derive an image of the structure of the lithosphere and upper mantle from P-to-S converted phases. Important results are as follows. The Moho at 70--80 km and a second discontinuity at 50--60 km depth are observed over the entire profile south and north of the Zangbo suture. The data from the GEDEPTH dense array enable the detection of inclined structures penetrating the crust at the Zangbo suture. A pronounced low-velocity zone exists north of the Zangbo suture at about 10--20 km depth. The locations of the upper mantle discontinuities at 410 and 660 km depth are in agreement with the global reference model IASP91 [Kennett, 1991] over a large region of the Himalaya and southern Tibet.},

To improve resolution and accuracy in the vicinity of mantle discontinuities, we extracted traveltimes of both initial and secondary phases observed at triplication distances by using a waveform fitting technique. Compared with the model obtained by using only the initial phase, the resolution just above the 410 km discontinuity is especially improved, and low-velocity anomalies beneath the Changbai Volcano are clearly observed down to the 410 km discontinuity. Compared with previous models, low-velocity anomalies atop the 410 are more pronounced. The results of this study together with the previous receiver function analysis provide further support that we have hot material beneath the Changbai Volcano.},

It is especially so for oceanic plates because their relatively simple creation and evolution should enable easy elucidation of the LAB. Data from borehole broadband ocean bottom seismometers show that the LAB beneath the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates is sharp and age-dependent. The observed large shear wave velocity reduction at the LAB requires a partially molten asthenosphere consisting of horizontal melt-rich layers embedded in meltless mantle, which accounts for the large viscosity contrast at the LAB that facilitates horizontal plate motions.},

Separate images are obtained for the vertical, radial, and transverse components using an automatic gain control algorithm which normalizes the amplitude of each trace prior to stacking. These images provide an indication of the relative signal-to-noise characteristics of different parts of the GDSN data set. Core-mantle boundary diffracted phases are particularly prominent in these stacks, which show P(diff) to 150-degrees, PKP(diff) to 200-degrees, PP(diff) to 230-degrees, S(diff) to 160-degrees, and SS(diff) to 220-degrees. High-order S surface multiples can be seen extending through the surface wave train up to ranges of 540-degrees. Two examples of possible upper mantle discontinuity reflected phases are visible, one following PPP between about 95-degrees and 125-degrees, the other following ScS3 between about 210-degrees and 240-degrees. An apparent offset between SH and SV arrivals is seen which becomes larger for the higher-order S multiples (SSS, SSSS, etc.), and appears consistent with models containing transverse isotropy in the upper mantle.},

	Abstract = {Anomalous boundary layer structure at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) is investigated using a global set of broadband SKS and SPdKS waves from permanent and portable broadband seismometer arrays. SPdKS is an SKS wave that intersects the CMB at the critical angle for ScP, thus initiating a diffracted P wave (Pdiff) along the CMB at the core entry and exit locations. The waveshape and timing of SPdKS data are analyzed relative to SKS, with some SPdKS data showing significant delays and broadening. Broadband data from several hundred deep focus earthquakes were analyzed; retaining data with simple sources and high signal-to-noise ratios resulted in 53 high-quality earthquakes. For each earthquake an empirical source was constructed by stacking pre-SPdKS distance range SKS pulses (∼90$\,^{\circ}$--100$\,^{\circ}$). These were utilized in our synthetic modeling process, whereby reflectivity synthetic seismograms are produced for three classes of models: (1) mantle-side ultralow-velocity zones (UVLZ), (2) underside CMB core rigidity zones, and (3) core-mantle transition zones. For ULVZ structures, ratios of P-to-S velocity reductions of 1:1 and 1:3 are explored, where 1:3 is appropriate for a partial melt origin of ULVZ. Over 330 unique CMB boundary layer models have been constructed and tested, corroborating previous work suggesting strong trade-offs between the three model spaces. We produce maps of inferred boundary layer structure from the global data and find evidence for extremely fine-scale heterogeneity where our wave path sampling is the densest. While uncertainties are present relating to the source versus receiver sides of the SPdKS wave path geometry, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that ULVZ presence (or absence) correlates with reduced (or average) heterogeneity in the overlying mantle.},

Understanding Earth's lower mantle requires putting recent seismic and mineral physics discoveries into a self-consistent, geodynamically feasible context. Two nearly antipodal large low-shear-velocity provinces in the deep mantle likely represent chemically distinct and denser material. High-resolution seismological studies have revealed laterally varying seismic velocity discontinuities in the deepest few hundred kilometers, consistent with a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite. In the deepest tens of kilometers of the mantle, isolated pockets of ultralow seismic velocities may denote Earth's deepest magma chamber.},

	Abstract = {Examples of Gr{\"{a}}fenberg-array data showing anomalous P-waves which typically arrive 3--5 s after the direct P-wave and which have a slowness 0.7--0.8 s deg-1 smaller than direct P are presented. This additional phase is most frequently observed for events located in the NE portion of the southern Kurile Island subduction zone 73$\,^{\circ}$-80$\,^{\circ}$ from Gr{\"{a}}fenberg, but systematically disappears for events in the SW portion of this zone.Because of the magnitude of the slowness difference, these observations cannot be attributed to a complex source rupture process nor to multipathing through the descending slab. Likewise, they may not be accounted for by near-receiver structure because these phases are not seen for all Kurile events. If present they appear at all stations of the array but they follow direct P too closely to be a multiple from the Mono. Therefore, we conclude they are very likely caused by lower mantle velocity structure.The most likely explanation is the presence of a P velocity jump of about 3 per cent approximately 290 km above the core-mantle boundary, since such a reflector in the lowermost mantle not only gives a good fit of traveltimes and slowness but is also able to model the waveform and the amplitudes of this additional P phase. The distribution of bounce points on this reflector for the Kurile events indicates a lateral extension of this velocity anomaly under northern Siberia of about 150 km by at least 200 km. The best fitting S-wave model has a reflector in the same depth, but the velocity contrast seems to be only about 2 per cent suggesting a different behaviour of the P and S velocity in D″.Few events from other regions in this distance range are suitable for a definitive analysis of this kind. From among this group some observations indicate a lower mantle anomaly under the Lomonosow Ridge and under northern Greenland; but since the lower mantle under western Siberia, northern Novaya Zemlya, the Azores Islands region and the USSR-Afghanistan border region does not produce an additional phase in the Gr{\"{a}}fenberg recordings it is very unlikely that such a velocity anomaly in the lowermost mantle is a global feature.},

	Abstract = {Temperature gradients in a low-shear-velocity province in the lowermost mantle (D″ region) beneath the central Pacific Ocean were inferred from the observation of a rapid S-wave velocity increase overlying a rapid decrease. These paired seismic discontinuities are attributed to a phase change from perovskite to post-perovskite and then back to perovskite as the temperature increases with depth. Iron enrichment could explain the occurrence of post-perovskite several hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary in this warm, chemically distinct province. The double phase-boundary crossing directly constrains the lowermost mantle temperature gradients. Assuming a standard but unconstrained choice of thermal conductivity, the regional core-mantle boundary heat flux (∼85 $\pm$ 25 milliwatts per square meter), comparable to the average at Earth's surface, was estimated, along with a lower bound on global core-mantle boundary heat flow in the range of 13 $\pm$ 4 terawatts. Mapped velocity-contrast variations indicate that the lens of post-perovskite minerals thins and vanishes over 1000 kilometers laterally toward the margin of the chemical distinct region as a result of a ∼500-kelvin temperature increase.},

	Abstract = {Broadband seismic shear waves are analyzed to investigate the fine-velocity structure in the lowermost mantle beneath the Cocos plate, a region where previous studies have indicated the presence of a shear velocity increase about 200--300 km above the core-mantle boundary. Data from 14 South American earthquakes recorded at California broadband networks provide dense ray path sampling of the lowermost mantle in an approximately 700 km long north-south corridor, roughly 150 km wide. Application of a simplified seismic migration method that uses a homogeneous background velocity model suggests topography of the previously imaged positive impedance jump, varying in depth from north to south by as much as 150 km, with a weakly reflecting transition zone in between. The migration approach enables examination of small-scale spatial variations and out-of-plane scattering effects. Topography of the discontinuity may account for observed variations in the amplitude of reflected arrivals or there may be lateral variations in the velocity contrast across the boundary. Lateral variations of the shear velocity structure within the D″ layer may produce some apparent topography in the discontinuity image, but any such volumetric structure is not yet well enough determined to incorporate in the migration. A localized negative impedance contrast reflector or scatterer is imaged at depths about 100 km below the positive reflector in the northern portion of the study area. Several scenarios can explain these results, including (1) a slab that reaches the lowermost mantle, (2) the birth of an upwelling beneath a recumbent slab, or (3) chemical layering in this region.},

	Abstract = {We used three-dimensional inverse scattering of core-reflected shear waves for large-scale, high-resolution exploration of Earth's deep interior (D'') and detected multiple, piecewise continuous interfaces in the lowermost layer (D'') beneath Central and North America. With thermodynamic properties of phase transitions in mantle silicates, we interpret the images and estimate in situ temperatures. A widespread wave-speed increase at 150 to 300 kilometers above the coremantle boundary is consistent with a transition from perovskite to postperovskite. Internal D'' stratification may be due to multiple phase-boundary crossings, and a deep wave-speed reduction may mark the base of a postperovskite lens about 2300 kilometers wide and 250 kilometers thick. The core-mantle boundary temperature is estimated at 3950 +/- 200 kelvin. Beneath Central America, a site of deep subduction, the D'' is relatively cold (DeltaT = 700 +/- 100 kelvin). Accounting for a factor-of-two uncertainty in thermal conductivity, core heat flux is 80 to 160 milliwatts per square meter (mW m(-2)) into the coldest D'' region and 35 to 70 mW m(-2) away from it. Combined with estimates from the central Pacific, this suggests a global average of 50 to 100 mW m(-2) and a total heat loss of 7.5 to 15 terawatts.},

	Abstract = {We developed a long-term, high-quality seismic ocean floor borehole observatory system, the `Neath Seafloor Equipment for Recording Earth's Internal Deformation (NEREID). Four NEREID borehole observatories were installed in the Japan Trench off-Sanriku area (JT1, JT2), in the northwestern Pacific Basin (WP2), and in the Philippine Sea (WP1). The borehole sensors are cemented in the borehole to assure good coupling of sensors to the ground as well as to avoid effects of water flow around the sensors, which may have been a problem in previous borehole installations. The NEREID seismic records from two of the observatories (JT1, WP2) were free from long-period noise due to turbulence in the seafloor boundary current or to water flowing around the sensor that is significant on the seafloor. The infragravity wave noise clearly observed around 0.01 Hz on the horizontal components was significantly higher in the JT1 seismometer in the sediment because of the low shear modulus of the sediment. Ocean waves of long wavelength cause the infragravity wave noise. It is thus necessary to install seismometers in boreholes below the sediments to reduce the infragravity wave noise.},

	Abstract = {In previous papers [Cummins et al., 1994ab] (hereafter referred to as DSMI and DSMII respectively), we presented accurate methods for computing complete synthetic seismograms for SH and P-SV respectively in a spherical earth model. The SH calculations used computationally efficient modified matrix operators, but the P-SV synthetics were computationally intensive. Geller and Takeuchi [1995] (hereafter referred to as GT95) presented a general theory for deriving modified operators and gave the explicit form of the modified operators for the P-SV case in cylindrical or cartesian coordinates. In this paper we extend GT95's results to derive modified operators for the P-SV case in spherical coordinates. The use of the modified operators reduces the CPU time by a factor of about 5 without a loss of accuracy. 10 CPU min on a SPARC-20 workstation with one CPU are required to compute a profile of synthetic seismograms from DC to 20 sec period.},

@article{Thomas2009,
	Abstract = {We probe low-velocity regions of the lower mantle with PKP waves using South Pacific earthquakes recorded at stations from the temporary Ethiopia Afar Geoscientific Lithospheric Experiment array in Ethiopia and the German Regional Seismic Network (GRSN; Germany). The Ethiopian stations show strong scattering of PKPab waves, which arrive as precursors to PKPdf. They also show anomalously large amplitude diffractions from the PKP b-caustic. In contrast, the events recorded at the GRSN show scattering of PKPab as precursors to PKPdf but more normal amplitudes in the PKP b-caustic diffractions. To understand the cause for the observed amplitudes, we test a large set of 1-D models with anomalies in P- and S-wave velocities and density in the lowermost mantle and outer core. Structures that can cause the observed large PKP b-caustic amplitudes are low-velocity regions just above the core-mantle boundary, of the order of 50 km thick for the South Pacific to Ethiopia path, with velocity reductions of around 5 per cent for P- and 25 per cent for the S-wave velocity. Alternatively a 30-km-thick lamella, starting at 50 km above the core-mantle boundary with 10 per cent P-wave velocity reduction and 25 per cent S-wave velocity reduction, also produces a good fit to the data. We find that the low-velocity regions act as waveguides, enhancing the amplitude of the PKP b-caustic diffracted waves and causing superposition of PKP b-diffractions with PKPdf. The low-velocity regions cannot be smooth layers but must show a certain degree of small-scale heterogeneity to produce the high-frequency scattering observed in the data. The path to Germany needs small scatterers in the lowermost mantle, but the low-velocity region is less strong compared with the South Pacific-Ethiopia path. A plausible explanation for these low-velocity regions is the presence of melt inclusions, perhaps entrained in small-scale convective systems that act as high-frequency wavefield scatterers. In regions where these inclusions or convective systems are abundant, they appear as a large-scale low-velocity zone to lower-frequency waves. These observations support ideas that ultra-low-velocity zones at the base of the mantle may be heterogeneous regions of melt-rich material.},

We assume that anisotropy is the result of plastic deformation within a large-scale flow induced by preferred growth at the inner core equator. Based on elastic moduli from the literature, body-centered cubic or face-centered cubic Fe produces seismic anisotropy well below seismic observations ({\textless}0.4{\%}). A Monte Carlo approach allows us to generalize this result to any form of elastic anisotropy in a cubic system. Within our model, inner core global anisotropy is not compatible with a cubic structure of Fe alloy. Hence, if the inner core material is indeed cubic, large-scale coherent anisotropic structures, incompatible with plastic deformation induced by large-scale flow, must be present.},

	Abstract = {It has recently been established that the Earth's free oscillations are continuously excited by phenomena other than earthquakes and that these oscillations constitute the background noise in the normal mode band at quiet sites. On the basis of evidence that the excitation source is at or just above the Earth's surface, a normal mode theory of the Earth's free oscillations excited by random atmospheric loading is developed. The displacement field is expressed in the frequency domain in general terms of the cross-spectral density of air pressure disturbance. For spatially homogeneous and isotropic disturbance the cross-spectral density is approximated by the power spectral density and the coefficient of coherence with a coherence length much shorter than the wavelengths of normal modes. With this approximation the spectrum of ground acceleration is represented as the product of the pressure force term and the Earth response term. The final expression of the acceleration spectrum includes the effect of the gravity attraction of a disturbed air mass. A synthetic spectrum is calculated, using a power law decaying air pressure spectrum consistent with observations, assuming a frequency-dependent coherence length of air pressure fluctuation, taking into account the effect of the gravity attraction of a disturbed air mass. This synthetic spectrum exhibits distinct peaks of fundamental modes and complex troughs consisting of overtone modes, in quantitative agreement with the peaks and troughs of the observed spectrum.},

	Abstract = {A tsunami earthquake is defined as a shock which generates extensive tsunamis but relatively weak seismic waves. A comparative study is made for the two recent tsunami earthquakes, and a subduction mechanism near a deep-sea trench is discussed. These two earthquakes occurred at extremely shallow depths far off the coasts of the Kurile Islands and of eastern Hokkaido on October 20, 1963, and on June 10, 1975, respectively. Both can be regarded as an aftershock of the preceding larger events. Their tsunami heights and seismic wave amplitudes are compared with those of the preceding events. The results show that the time constants involved in the tsunami earthquakes are relatively long but not long enough to explain the observed disproportionality between the tsunamis and the seismic waves. The process times are estimated to be less than 100 s. The spatio-temporal characteristics of the two events suggest that they represent a seaward and upward extension of the rupture associated with a great earthquake which did not break the free surface at the coseismic stage. The amplitude and phase spectra of long-period surface waves and the long-period P waveforms indicate that this extension of the rupture did not take place entirely along the lithospheric interface emerging as a trench axis. It rather branched upward from the interface in a complex way through the wedge portion at the leading edge of the continental lithosphere. This wedge portion consists in large part of thick deformable sediments. A large vertical deformation and hence extensive tsunamis result from such a branching process. A shallowest source depth, steepening of rupture surfaces, and a deformable nature of the source region all enhance generation of tsunamis. The wedge portion ruptured by a tsunami earthquake is usually characterized by a very low seismic activity which is presumably due to ductility of the sediments. We suggest that this portion fractures in a brittle way to generate a tsunami earthquake when it is loaded suddenly by the occurrence of a great earthquake and that otherwise it yields slowly. Upward branching of the rupture from the lithospheric interface produces permanent deformation of the free surface which is relative uplift landward and relative subsidence trenchward of the zone of surface break. This surface break zone geomorphologically corresponds to the lower continental slope between the deep-sea terrace and the trench. Such a mode of permanent deformation seems to be consistent with a rising feature of the outer ridge of the deep-sea terrace and a depressional feature of the trench. This consistency implies a causal relationship between great earthquake activities and geomorphological features near the trench.},

	Abstract = {The South Pacific region is characterized by a broadly elevated seafloor known as the South Pacific superswell. This region has a concentration of midplate volcanoes that experienced massive eruptions in the mid-Cretaceous period (90-120 Ma). These characteristics suggest the presence of a large-scale mantle plume beneath the South Pacific, called the South Pacific superplume. The geometry, origin depth, temperature, and composition of the superplume remain controversial, however, mainly due to the lack of seismological data that documents the mantle structure beneath the South Pacific. Seismic stations are sparse in the area due to its remote ocean environment. To obtain a better seismic image of the superplume, we deployed temporary broadband seismographs on oceanic islands and the seafloor in the South Pacific, which made possible the highest spatial resolution that has ever been achieved for the mantle structure beneath the region. The seismic image obtained from this new seismic data indicates that large-scale low-velocity anomalies (on the order of 1000 km in diameter), indicative of the superplume, are located from the bottom of the mantle to a depth of 1000 km, and small-scale low-velocity anomalies (on the order of 100 km in diameter) are present above it. A comparison of the seismic image with recent mantle convection studies based upon laboratory and numerical experiments suggests that the superplume may be a hot and chemically distinct mantle dome, and that the small-scale anomalies may be narrow plumes generated from the top of the dome. This model may explain various characteristics of hot spots in the South Pacific, such as the seafloor swell, short-lived hot spot chains, and the periodicity of massive eruptions.},

	Abstract = {The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake caused a devastating tsunami along the shoreline from the Tohoku to Kanto districts. Although many of the tide gauge stations along the Tohoku coast were saturated or damaged due to the tsunami, two cabled ocean-bottom tsunami sensors installed off Kamaishi successfully recorded the tsunami waveform just above the source rupture area. The records indicated a characteristic two-stage tsunami development sequence: a smoothly increasing tsunami amplitude from 0 to 2 m during the first 800 s from the earthquake origin time, and a short-period impulsive tsunami with a peak of more than 5 m in the following 200 s. Such observations strongly suggest the lack of any sea floor upheaval at the stations during the earthquake, and the occurrence of an extremely large slip in the shallow portion of the subducting Pacific Plate near the trench axis. The source model derived from the offshore tsunami records indicates that a very large slip of 57 m occurred off Miyagi near the trench axis, south of the rupture area of the 1896 Meiji Sanriku tsunami earthquake, and was the major source of the highly destructive tsunami that subsequently developed.},

After correction for the effects of earthquake mislocation and the seismic heterogeneities outside the Pacific Anomaly, seismic observations suggest that the Pacific Anomaly along the great arc consists of at least two separated portions with a 740-km-wide gap between them. The western portion of the anomaly is about 1050 km wide, extends at least 740 km above the core-mantle boundary (CMB), and exhibits a trapezoidal shape with lateral dimensions increasing slightly with depth. The velocity structure of the western portion varies from −3.0{\%} at the top (740 km above the CMB) to −3.5{\%} at 100 km above the CMB and an average shear-velocity reduction of −5{\%} in the bottom 100 km of the mantle. The eastern portion of the anomaly reaches at least 340 km above the CMB beneath the mid-Pacific with an 1800-km-wide base and has a uniform velocity reduction of −3{\%}. Waveform modeling further suggests a very low velocity layer with a shear-velocity reduction of −10{\%} located at the edge of the western portion of the anomaly. Combining the latest results from others, we present a general picture of structural and velocity structures of the Pacific Anomaly. The structural and velocity features suggest that the anomaly represents a cluster of metastable thermo-chemical piles. },

@article{Eken2014,
	Abstract = {To overcome the potential contamination of the direct S waves by source‐side anisotropy in shear‐wave‐splitting analysis, we describe a new approach that we call the reference station technique. The technique utilizes direct shear waves recorded at a station pair and depends on maximizing the correlation between the seismic traces at reference and target stations after correcting the reference station for known receiver‐side anisotropy and the target stations for arbitrary splitting parameters probed via a grid search. The algorithm also provides a delay time between both stations caused, for example, by isotropic heterogeneities. Synthetic tests demonstrate the stability of the estimated parameters, even where variability in near‐surface properties (thickness and velocity of sediment layer) exists. We applied the reference station technique to data from seismic experiments at the northern margin of Tibet. Average splitting parameters obtained from the analysis of direct S‐wave results are consistent with those obtained from previous SKS splitting measurements. Where differences exist, shear‐wave fast polarization estimates resolved from direct S indicate a higher degree of internal consistency for closely spaced stations than those derived from SKS. This is probably due to the much larger number of direct S waves available for splitting measurements compared to SKS for the same observational period, resulting in higher quality measurements. We also demonstrate the ability of the technique to provide improved splitting measurements for temporary stations by following a bootstrap approach in which only a few stations with well‐constrained SKS splitting parameters are used as seeds to determine the splitting parameters of a large array in an iterative manner. In addition, the S measurements sample the anisotropic layer with different angles of incidence and back azimuths, thus potentially providing additional constraints on more complicated anisotropic structures, and the interstation delay times could be used for tomographic studies to reduce the bias from anisotropic structure.Online Material: Multisplit software package (C++) with instructions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The central Japanese subduction zone is characterized by a complex tectonic setting affected by the dual subduction of oceanic plates and collisions between the island arcs. To better understand of the subduction system, we performed an anisotropic tomography analysis using P-wave arrival times from local earthquakes to determine the three-dimensional structure of P-wave azimuthal anisotropy in the overriding plate and the Pacific and Philippine Sea (PHS) slabs. The principal characteristics of anisotropy in the subducted and subducting plates are (1) in the overriding plate, the distribution pattern of fast direction of crustal anisotropy coincides with that of the strike of geological structure, (2) in the two oceanic plates, fast propagation directions of P-wave were sub-parallel to the directions of seafloor spreading. Additionally, our tomographic images demonstrate that (1) the bottom of the Median Tectonic Line, the longest fault zone in Japan, reaches to the lower crust, and seems to link to the source region of an inter-plate earthquake along the PHS slab, (2) the segmentation of the PHS slab -- the Izu Islands arc, the Nishi-Shichito ridge, and the Shikoku basin -- due to the formation history, is reflected in the regional variation of anisotropy. The tomographic study further implies that there might be a fragment of the Pacific slab suggested by a previous study beneath the Tokyo metropolitan area. The overall findings strongly indicate that seismic anisotropy analysis provide potentially useful information to understand a subduction zone.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This study presents a total of 12008 shear wave splitting measurements obtained using the reference-station technique applied to direct S-waves from 106 earthquakes recorded at 143 seismic stations of the Hi-CLIMB seismic network. The results reveal significant anisotropy in regions of southern Tibet where null or negligible anisotropy has been hitherto reported from SK(K)S measurements. While the individual fast polarization direction (FPD) at each station are found to be consistent, the splitting time delays (TDs) exhibit deviations particularly at stations located south of the Indus--Tsangpo Suture Zone. The fast polarization directions (FPDs) are oriented (a) NE--SW to E--W to the south of the Indus--Tsangpo Suture Zone (b) NE--SW to ENE--SSW between Bangong--Nujiang Suture Zone and the Indus--Tsangpo Suture Zone (ITSZ) and (c) E--W to the extreme north of the profile. The splitting time delays ( $\delta$ t ) vary between 0.45 and 1.3 s south of the ITSZ ({\textless}30$\,^{\circ}$N latitude), while they range from 0.9 to 1.4 s north of it. The overall trends are similar to SKS/SKKS results. However, the differences may be due to the not so near vertical paths of direct S waves which may sample the anisotropy in a different way in comparison to SKS waves, or insufficient number of SKS observations. The significant anisotropy ( ∼ 0.8 s) observed beneath Himalaya reveals a complex deformation pattern in the region and can be best explained by the combined effects of deformation related to shear at the base of the lithosphere and subduction related flows with possible contributions from the crust. Additional measurements obtained using direct S-waves provide new constraints in regions with complex anisotropy.},

	Abstract = {The possibilities and limitations of the theoretical investigation of elastic waves in horizontally layered media with the aid of the exact ray theory are studied. In order to simplify the problem as far as possible, it is restricted to the propagation of sound waves from a line source in a layered-liquid medium. Three different types of the transition between two homogeneous liquids are investigated: a first-order discontinuity, a transition consisting of a prescribed number of homogeneous layers, and a transition layer with linear variation of sound velocity and density with depth. Theoretical seismograms are computed by exact formulas and by wave front approximations for the reflected waves in these models. From these results, the main conclusions about the applicability of the exact ray theory to studies of wave propagation in more complicated media are as follows: (1) The exact ray theory is applicable to the investigation of vertical and near-vertical reflections from inhomogeneous media without difficulties; and (2) continuously refracted waves in such media can be investigated by an approximation which is sufficient for many practical cases. The final aim of this study was to test whether the exact ray theory can be used to compute theoretical seismograms for seismological applications. Therefore, some approximations were developed which are useful for computations for realistic models of the Earth's crust and upper mantle. An Earth-flattening approximation is given which accounts for the influence of the Earth's curvature on the propagation of body waves, and the approximate computation of point source seismograms from line source seismograms is described. An example of theoretical seismograms is presented for an upper mantle model, published by Julian {\&} Anderson (1968).},

	Abstract = {Detailed knowledge of lithospheric structure is essential for understanding the long-term evolution and dynamics of continents. We present an image of lithospheric structure across the central and western North China Craton (NCC), derived using S and P receiver functions from a dense seismic array. A negative velocity discontinuity is identified at ∼80--100 km depth within the thick lithosphere (∼160--200 km), similar to that observed in many other cratonic regions and roughly at the same depth as the base of the lithosphere in the eastern NCC. The intralithospheric discontinuity may indicate an ancient, mechanically weak layer within the overall strong cratonic lithosphere, and probably also existed beneath the eastern NCC before the Mesozoic. The presence of such a weak layer could have facilitated simultaneous lithospheric modification at the base and the middle of the lithosphere in the eastern NCC, especially under the strong influence of the Mesozoic Pacific subduction, leading to the severe lithospheric thinning and destruction recorded in this region. The weak layer probably did not strongly affect the stability and evolution of the central and western NCC and other cratonic regions where effects from plate boundary processes were weak. Our seismic images, integrated with geological data, provide new insights into structural heterogeneities in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle and their roles in the dynamic evolution of continents.},

In the early period (before 2003), the ICB is enlarged beneath the western coast of Gabon, Republic of Congo, and southwest Tanzania in the reflected points of the PKiKP observed at seismic stations OBN, AAK, and ARU, while it experiences little change beneath Zimbabwe or/and Kenya, and beneath west Angola or/and north Central African Republic, in the PKIKP entry or/and exit points of AAK and ARU observations, respectively. In the later period (after 1998), the ICB regions beneath the western coast of Gabon, Republic of Congo, and southwest Tanzania either shrink or remain unchanged, and the temporal change migrates to beneath Zimbabwe or/and Kenya, and beneath west Angola or/and north Central African Republic, with a decrease of inner core surface by 5.59 km between 1998 and 2009 beneath Zimbabwe or Kenya and by 1.73 km beneath west Angola or north Central African Republic between 1998 and 2013. These results indicate that ICB temporal change occurs in localized regions and is episodic, rapidly migrating, and alternately enlarged and shrunk.},

	Abstract = {We conduct an experiment to investigate whether linearity in the observed velocity gradient in the volume of the inner core sampled by the PKP ray paths beneath Central America is a robust approximation. Instead of solving an optimization problem, we approach it within the Bayesian inference. This is an ensemble approach, where model specification is relaxed so that instead of only one solution, groups of reasonable models are acceptable. Furthermore, in transdimensional Bayesian inference used here, the number of basis functions needed to model observations is by itself an unknown. Our modeling reveals that in the ensemble of models, the most likely are those containing only 2 nodes (linear trend). Thus our result justifies the assumption used for the determination of inner core rotation with respect to the rest of the mantle that the observed gradient is constant in its nature (linear). Recent observations in seismology suggest that it is likely that the spatial variability in elastic parameters is a widespread phenomenon in the inner core. Future array observations will further constrain spatial extent and magnitude of velocity changes and show whether there is a significant difference between these observations in the two quasi-hemispheres of the inner core. {\textcopyright} 2013 China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Frequency-dependent reflection coefficients of P waves at the inner core boundary (ICB) are estimated from the spectral ratios of PKiKP and PcP waves observed by the high-sensitivity seismograph network (Hi-net) in Japan. The corresponding PKiKP reflection locations at the ICB are distributed beneath the western Pacific. At frequencies where noise levels are sufficiently low, spectra of reflection coefficients show four distinct sets of characteristics: a flat spectrum, a spectrum with a significant spectral hole at approximately 1 or 3 Hz, a spectrum with a strong peak at approximately 2 or 3 Hz, and a spectrum containing both a sharp peak and a significant hole. The variety in observed spectra suggests complex lateral variations in ICB properties. To explain the measured differences in frequency characteristics of ICB reflection coefficients, we conduct 2D finite difference simulations of seismic wavefields near the ICB. The models tested in our simulations include a liquid layer and a solid layer above the ICB, as well as sinusoidal and spike-shaped ICB topography with varying heights and scale lengths. We find that the existence of a layer above the ICB can be excluded as a possible explanation for the observed spectra. Furthermore, we find that an ICB topographic model with wavelengths and heights of several kilometers is too extreme to explain our measurements. However, restricting the ICB topography to wavelengths and heights of 1.0--1.5 km can explain the observed frequency-related phenomena. The existence of laterally varying topography may be a sign of lateral variations in inner core solidification.},

	Abstract = {Broad-band P- and S-waves from earthquakes in South America recorded at Californian network stations are analysed to image lateral variations of the D″-discontinuity beneath the Cocos plate. We apply two array processing methods to the data set: a simplified migration method to the P-wave data set and a double-array method to both the P- and S-wave data sets, allowing us to compare results from the two methods. The double-array method images a dipping reflector at a depth range from 2650 to 2700 km in the southern part of the study area. We observe a step-like topography of 100 km to a shallower reflector at about 2600 km depth to the north, as well as evidence for a second (deeper) reflector at a depth range from 2700 to 2750 km in the north. Results from the simplified migration agree well with those from the double-array method, similarly locating a large step in reflector depth in a similar location (about 2650 km depth in the south and about 2550 km in the north) as well as the additional deeper reflector at the depth of about 2750 km in the north. Waveform modelling of the reflected waves from both methods suggests a positive velocity contrast for S waves, but a negative velocity contrast for P waves for the upper reflector in agreement with predictions from mineral physical calculations for a post-perovskite phase transition. The data also show some evidence for the existence of another deeper reflector that could indicate a double intersection of the geotherm with the post-perovskite stability field, that is, the back-transformation of post-perovskite to perovskite close to the core--mantle boundary.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Previous analysis of short period PcP with seismic array reported rapid variation of PcP amplitude and suggested small scale variation of core--mantle boundary (CMB) topography beneath Kenai Peninsula (Alaska). In order to constrain the length scale (L) and topographic height variation (H) in the region, we quantitatively compute synthetic PcP seismograms using the seismic representation theorem for a core--mantle boundary (CMB) with topography bump (H {\textgreater} 0) or depression (H {\textless} 0). We model PcP amplitudes for L in the range of 60--500 km, H in the range of −6 km (depression) to 5 km (bump). It is observed that CMB depressions do produce amplification and CMB bumps generate de-amplification for short period PcP amplitudes. After computation for various combinations of L and H, amplification in the range of 2--4.5 is observed in the above mentioned parameter ranges. The topography model of a CMB depression (H = −6 km, L = 6$\,^{\circ}$) predicts 1 Hz PcP amplification consistent with observed PcP amplitude variation beneath Kenai Peninsula. However, PcP amplitude can also be affected by heterogeneities in the crust and mantle, the estimated topography could be less pronounced.},

	Abstract = {Resolving the topography of the core--mantle boundary (CMB) and the structure and composition of the D″ region is key to improving our understanding of the interaction between the Earth's mantle and core. Observations of traveltimes and amplitudes of short-period teleseismic body waves sensitive to lowermost mantle provide essential constraints on the properties of this region. Major challenges are low signal-to-noise ratio of the target phases and interference with other mantle phases. In a previous paper (Part I), we introduced the slant-stacklet transform to enhance the signal of the core-reflected (PcP) phase and to isolate it from stronger signals in the coda of the P wave. Then we minimized a linear misfit between P and PcP waveforms to improve the quality of PcP--P traveltime difference measurements as compared to standard cross-correlation methods. This method significantly increases the quantity and the quality of PcP--P traveltime observations available for the modelling of structure near the CMB. Here we illustrate our approach in a series of regional studies of the CMB and D″ using PcP--P observations with unprecedented resolution from high-quality dense arrays located in North America and Japan for events with magnitude Mw{\textgreater}5.4 and distances up to 80{\$}\backslashdeg{\$}. In this process, we carefully analyse various sources of errors and show that mantle heterogeneity is the most significant. We find and correct bias due to mantle heterogeneities that is as large as 1 s in traveltime, comparable to the largest lateral PcP--P traveltime variations observed. We illustrate the importance of accurate mantle corrections and the need for higher resolution mantle models for future studies. After optimal mantle corrections, the main signal left is relatively long wavelength in the regions sampled, except at the border of the Pacific large-low shear velocity province (LLSVP). We detect the northwest border of the Pacific LLSVP in the western Pacific from array observations in Japan, and observe higher than average P velocities, or depressed CMB, in Central America, and slightly lower than average P velocities under Alaska/western Canada.},

	Abstract = {In order to study fine scale structure of the Earth's deep interior, it is necessary to extract generally weak body wave phases from seismograms that interact with various discontinuities and heterogeneities. The recent deployment of large-scale dense arrays providing high-quality data, in combination with efficient seismic data processing techniques, may provide important and accurate observations over large portions of the globe poorly sampled until now. Major challenges are low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and interference with unwanted neighbouring phases. We address these problems by introducing scale-dependent slowness filters that preserve time-space resolution. We combine complex wavelet and slant-stack transforms to obtain the slant-stacklet transform. This is a redundant high-resolution directional wavelet transform with a direction (here slowness) resolution that can be adapted to the signal requirements. To illustrate this approach, we use this expansion to design coherence-driven filters that allow us to obtain clean PcP observations (a weak phase often hidden in the coda of the P wave), for events with magnitude Mw {\textgreater} 5.4 and distances up to 80$\,^{\circ}$. In this context, we then minimize a linear misfit between P and PcP waveforms to improve the quality of PcP--P traveltime measurements as compared to a standard cross-correlation method. This significantly increases both the quantity and the quality of PcP--P differential traveltime measurements available for the modelling of structure near the core--mantle boundary. The accuracy of our measurements is limited mainly by the highest frequencies of the signals used and the level of noise. We apply this methodology to two examples of high-quality data from dense arrays located in north America. While focusing here on body-wave separation, the tools we propose are more general and may contribute to enhancing seismic signal observations in global seismology in situations of low SNR and high signal interference.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A direct image of P-wave reflectivity in the lithosphere and asthenosphere beneath seismic stations is extracted from stacked autocorrelograms of continuous component records. The autocorrelograms emphasise near vertically travelling waves, so that multiples are more muted than in receiver function studies and it is possible to work at higher frequencies than for receiver functions. Across a wide range of geological environments in Australia, in the 0.5--4.0 Hz frequency band, distinct reflections are seen in the crust underlain by weaker reflectivity in the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The base of crustal reflectivity fits well with Moho estimates from other classes of information. Few mantle reflectors have been seen in conventional reflection profiling at frequencies above 10 Hz; the presence of reflections in the 0.5--4.0 Hz band suggests variations on vertical scales of a few hundred metres with amplitudes of the order of 1{\%}. There are slight indications of a change of reflection character in the lower part of the lithosphere in the transition to the asthenosphere. At a few stations there is a very clear lamination at asthenospheric depth, as well as reflections from the base of the S wave low velocity zone. Reflection bands often occur at depths where discontinuities have been inferred from S wave receiver function work at the same station, but would not by themselves be distinctive of a mid-lithosphere discontinuity.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A 3-D crustal and upper mantle S-wave velocity model of NE China is constructed by inversion of phase velocity dispersion curves at 6--140 s periods from ambient noise tomography and two-plane surface wave tomography. The seismic data used in this study are collected from 120 China Earthquake Administration (CEA) permanent stations and 127 portable stations of NECESSArray. We observe strong low S-wave velocity beneath the Changbaishan volcano in the upper mantle to at least 200-km depth, which is interpreted as a mantle upwelling beneath the Changbaishan volcano that is consistent with the body wave tomographic image. The Songliao Basin is dominated by a high velocity extending to at least 200-km depth. Built upon the observed velocity anomalies, we propose a sub-lithosphere mantle convection model for NE China in which the upwelling of upper mantle materials from the mantle transition zone to the Changbaishan volcano could induce a local sub-lithosphere convection in the upper mantle and the strong high velocity of the upper mantle beneath the Songliao Basin corresponds to the downwelling limb of this convection cell. The downwelling beneath the Songliao Basin could also induce secondary local convection in the asthenosphere to the west, leading to local asthenospheric upwelling beneath the Abaga and Halaha volcanoes in the Xing'an--Mongolia Orogenic Belt.},

@article{Colombi2014,
	Abstract = {The topography of the core--mantle boundary (CMB) is directly linked to the dynamics of both the mantle and the outer core, although it is poorly constrained and understood. Recent studies have produced topography models with mutual agreement up to degree 2. A broad-band waveform inversion strategy is introduced and applied here, with relatively low computational cost and based on a first-order Born approximation. Its performance is validated using synthetic waveforms calculated in theoretical earth models that include different topography patterns with varying lateral wavelengths, from 600 to 2500 km, and magnitudes (∼10 km peak-to-peak). The source--receiver geometry focuses mainly on the Pdiff, PKP, PcP and ScS phases. The results show that PKP branches, PcP and ScS generally perform well and in a similar fashion, while Pdiff yields unsatisfactory results. We investigate also how 3-D mantle correction influences the output models, and find that despite the disturbance introduced, the models recovered do not appear to be biased, provided that the 3-D model is correct. Using cross-correlated traveltimes, we derive new topography models from both P and S waves. The static corrections used to remove the mantle effect are likely to affect the inversion, compromising the agreement between models derived from P and S data. By modelling traveltime residuals starting from sensitivity kernels, we show how the simultaneous use of volumetric and boundary kernels can reduce the bias coming from mantle structures. The joint inversion approach should be the only reliable method to invert for CMB topography using absolute cross-correlation traveltimes.},

	Abstract = {We use a total of 839,369 PcP, PKPab, PKPbc, PKPdf, PKKPab, and PKKPbc residual travel times from [Bull. Seism. Soc. Am. 88 (1998) 722] grouped in 29,837 summary rays to constrain lateral variation in the depth to the core--mantle boundary (CMB). We assumed a homogeneous outer core, and the data were corrected for mantle structure and inner-core anisotropy. Inversions of separate data sets yield amplitude variations of up to 5 km for PcP, PKPab, PKPbc, and PKKP and 13 km for PKPdf. This is larger than the CMB undulations inferred in geodetic studies and, moreover, the PcP results are not readily consistent with the inferences from PKP and PKKP. Although the source--receiver ambiguity for the core-refracted phases can explain some of it, this discrepancy suggest that the travel-time residuals cannot be explained by topography alone. The wavespeed perturbations in the tomographic model used for the mantle corrections might be too small to fully account for the trade off between volumetric heterogeneity and CMB topography. In a second experiment we therefore re-applied corrections for mantle structure outside a basal 290 km-thick layer and inverted all data jointly for both CMB topography and volumetric heterogeneity within this layer. The resultant CMB model can explain PcP, PKP, and PKKP residuals and has approximately 0.2 km excess core ellipticity, which is in good agreement with inferences from free core nutation observations. Joint inversion yields a peak-to-peak amplitude of CMB topography of about 3 km, and the inversion yields velocity variations of $\pm$5{\%} in the basal layer. The latter suggests a strong trade-off between topography and volumetric heterogeneity, but uncertainty analyses suggest that the variation in core radius can be resolved. The spherical averages of all inverted topographic models suggest that the data are best fit if the actual CMB radius is 1.5 km less than in the Earth reference model used (i.e. the average outer core radius would be 3478 km).},

	Abstract = {The core--mantle boundary (CMB) topography is an important parameter for constraining the models of mantle dynamics and core--mantle coupling. However, the various large wavelength seismological models of the CMB topography, which have been obtained up to now, are poorly correlated. Moreover, their maximum amplitudes vary considerably from one model to another, with values ranging from $\pm$4 to $\pm$12 km. These large discrepancies may be due to the difficulty to separate, in the travel time anomalies, the contribution of the CMB topography from that of the highly heterogeneous D″ region at the base of the mantle. In order to better constrain the amplitude of the CMB topography, we perform a stochastic analysis of the core phases which sample the CMB as transmitted waves and/or as reflected waves. In particular, we analyse underside reflected PKKP phases, which help to discriminate between CMB topography and D″ structure, and have in addition a great sensitivity to CMB topography. The other phases used are the upperside reflected waves PcP, and the transmitted waves PKP. The analysis is performed on the travel time residual file obtained by Engdahl et al. [Engdahl, E.R., van der Hilst, R., Buland, R.P., 1998. Global teleseismic earthquake relocation with improved travel times and procedures for depth determination. Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am. 88, 722--743.] after earthquake relocation and phase re-identification. After careful travel time data selection, the stochastic analysis allows us to separate coherent signal from random signal in the data at different length scales ranging from 300 to 1500 km. Then the CMB topography variance is obtained at the different length scales from a joint analysis of the coherent signal in the different core phases, in taking into account their different sensitivities to CMB topography. The estimated CMB topography variance has a significant signal in the wavelength range that we have investigated, showing that 95{\%} of CMB topography amplitude is in the range $\pm$∼4.0 km for wavelengths larger than 300 km. This value decreases to $\pm$∼1.5 km for wavelengths larger than 1200 km, indicating that the long wavelength CMB topography is significantly lower than previously proposed. However, it has not been possible to invert the data for deriving a map of the CMB topography. A checkerboard pattern analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of the PKKP phase, the relative contributions of D″ heterogenieties and CMB topography cannot be separated with the presently available data.},

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional (2-D) finite-difference (FD) synthetics, which fill the gap between fast 1-D analytic synthetics and time-consuming full 3-D synthetics in our ability to model seismograms, have been used in many studies. We address several issues involving 2-D FD methods in generating global synthetic seismograms. These include: (1) interfacing point source excitation for earthquakes with 2-D FD methods; (2) out-of-plane spreading corrections and (3) reducing the spherical Earth to the flattened models. The first issue is tackled using two methods, a `transparent source box' approach and a moment tensor excitation approach, where each has its own advantages. Moreover, our `source box' excitation does not have the late-time drift problem that occurred in previous studies. The out-of-plane geometric spreading correction is accounted for by estimating the ray parameter and applying a post-simulation filter to 2-D synthetics. Finally, parameters of the Earth-flattening transformation are discussed and validated. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by comparing our synthetics with frequency--wavenumber summation, normal-mode and 3-D spectral-element synthetics.},

	Abstract = {The frequencies of Earth's normal modes are split by rotation, ellipticity, and internal structure of the Earth. Thus, models of mantle heterogeneity and discontinuity topography generate splitting that may be tested against observations. We insert maps of core-mantle boundary (CMB) topography, which are derived via either a purely seismic or a joint tomographic/geodynamic inversion of body waves data, on top of tomographic model S20RTS. We then calculate synthetic splitting functions for normal modes that have been shown to be sensitive to CMB topography and compare these to observed normal mode splitting data. The CMB topography maps obtained via geodynamically constrained tomography fit normal mode data better than purely seismic maps, in particular when the geodynamic constraint also accounts for the presence of post-perovskite in the D″ region. We test the significance of the reduction in misfit using the concept of observability which suggests that normal modes are able to observe the difference between the different CMB topography maps. In addition, we find that the statistical significance, assessed by checking what fraction of 1000 randomly generated CMB models achieve a comparatively good fit as the desired model, is higher than 92{\%} for degree 2 and 98{\%} for all degrees. In summary, we have identified a model of CMB topography that fits body wave data and improves, at least to some extent, the fit to normal mode data, and is coherent with the large-scale pattern of deep mantle heterogeneity expected on the basis of convection modeling.},

	Abstract = {PcP arrival times reported to the International Seismological Centre (ISC) are inverted for vertical travel time anomaly at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We first invert about 2×106 ISC first P arrival data for the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the mantle and hypocenter locations iteratively. The PcP data are corrected for the relocated hypocenters and the 3-D structure. This correction has reduced the observed PcP residuals. The corrected PcP data are then inverted for the vertical travel time anomalies at the CMB, which are due either to velocity anomaly or topographic anomaly. The spherical average of the inverted structure requires either a velocity reduction in the boundary layer just above the CMB (by ∼3{\%} if the layer is 20 km thick) or a lowering of the CMB by 3 km. The heterogeneity pattern of the CMB is drastically different from that of the overlying D′′ layer. Negative vertical travel time anomalies appear in the northern high-latitude region, and positive anomalies appear under Southeast Asia and Middle to South America. The lateral dimensions of these anomalies are of the order of 40$\,^{\circ}$. The anomalies can be interpreted as either a velocity perturbation in the boundary layer ($\pm$∼7{\%} if the layer is 20 km thick) or an undulation of the CMB ($\pm$∼7 km). Various tests including the error and resolution estimations indicate that these three anomalies are the significant, resolvable features of the CMB. These anomalies are also corroborated by the result of the joint inversion of P and PcP for both the 3-D mantle and the 2-D CMB. Assuming that the layer is laterally heterogeneous in iron content and deforms at the base in isostatic equilibrium with the outer core, the PcP data are also inverted for the isostatic figure of the boundary layer. The velocity perturbation in this case is 5∼6{\%} if the layer is 20 km thick, and the CMB undulation is only $\pm$1∼2 km. Regardless whether the CMB heterogeneity is due to velocity and/or topographic perturbations, it is dominant in the zonal component of degree 2, while the degree 2 pattern in the lower mantle, including the D′′, is dominant in sectorial component.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear explosions at the French test sites in the South Pacific have been recorded at the regional seismic networks in the western United States. A total of approximately 600 good-quality, short-period seismograms were selected from an initial set of 900. The dense receiver spacing, particularly in California, allows the division of the networks into numerous subarrays and the data from each subarray can be analysed using conventional array techniques such as beam-forming and frequency---wave-number analysis. The seismic rays provide dense sampling of a small area of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) beneath the eastern Pacific from 5$\,^{\circ}$ to 13$\,^{\circ}$N and 133$\,^{\circ}$ to 126$\,^{\circ}$W. PcP has a shallow incidence angle on the CMB at an epicentral distance of 65$\,^{\circ}$ and D″ is sampled over a large swathe from 2$\,^{\circ}$S to 24$\,^{\circ}$N and from 134$\,^{\circ}$ to 123$\,^{\circ}$W. Beam traces have been formed for the P and PcP phases for each of the subarrays, using slowness and azimuth values derived from array methods. Good-quality beams have been selected for further analysis. By applying a matched filter to the beamed traces, an accurate set of PcP-P differential travel times has been determined and compared with IASP91. The residuals show a smooth trend over the area sampled. For the given epicentral distances, P and PcP have similar paths through the crust and upper mantle so we make the assumption that near-source and near-receiver structures have negligible effect on the differential times. We also assume that the midmantle is relatively homogenous. Many previous studies have interpreted PcP-P residuals in terms of CMB topography. By mapping the residuals directly to topography, a range in elevation of 40 km over a lateral extent of about 700 km results. Alternatively, we attempted to interpret the residuals in terms of velocity heterogeneity in D″. A range of D″ models have been tested including lateral velocity variation in a D″ layer with constant thickness. The PcP-P residuals may be explained by allowing the P-wave velocity to vary laterally by a factor of 2{\%} over the region sampled, with most of the region being marginally fast. This suggests that D″ heterogeneity has large spectral power at relatively short wavelengths. In this scenario, previous tomographic inversions for CMB topography will have large errors since in these inversions, corrections for D″ structure are based on low-order spherical harmonic models.},

	Abstract = {The inner core boundary marks the phase transition between the solid inner core and the fluid outer core. As the site of inner core solidification, the boundary provides insight into the processes generating the seismic structures of the inner core. In particular, it may hold the key to understanding the previously observed hemispherical asymmetry in inner core seismic velocity, anisotropy, and attenuation. Here we use a large PKiKP-PcP amplitude ratio and travel time residual data set to investigate velocity and density contrast properties near the inner core boundary. Although hemispherical structure at the boundary has been proposed by previous inner core studies, we find no evidence for hemispheres in the amplitude ratios or travel time residuals. In addition, we find that the amplitude ratios are much larger than can be explained by variations in density contrast at the inner core boundary or core-mantle boundary. This indicates that PKiKP is primarily observed when it is anomalously large, due to focusing along its raypath. Using data in which PKiKP is not detected above the noise level, we calculate an upper estimate for the inner core boundary (ICB) density contrast of 1.2 kg m−3. The travel time residuals display large regional variations, which differ on long and short length scales. These regions may be explained by large-scale velocity variations in the F layer just above the inner core boundary, and/or small-scale topography of varying magnitude on the ICB, which also causes the large amplitudes. Such differences could arise from localized freezing and melting of the inner core.},

Here we examine a large global data set of PKP precursors in individual seismograms and array data, to better understand scattering locations. The precursor amplitudes from individual seismograms are analyzed with respect to the inner core phase PKIKP and mantle phase PP. We find and correct for a hemispherical asymmetry in the precursor/PKIKP amplitudes, resulting from inner core structure. Using ray tracing, we locate scatterers in our array data and use these to infer scattering locations in the individual data. The scattering strength displays regional variation; however, we find no relationship with long-scale core-mantle boundary velocity structure. Scattering is observed in all regions of data coverage, as are paths with no precursors. This indicates that scattering occurs from various small-scale heterogeneities, including but not limited to ultralow velocity zones or partial melt, and slabs.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Deep-focus earthquakes, located in very high-pressure conditions 300 to 700 km below the Earth's surface within sinking slabs of relatively cold oceanic lithosphere, are mysterious phenomena. The largest recorded deep-focus earthquake (MW 7.9) in the Izu--Bonin slab struck on 30 May 2015 beneath the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, isolated from prior seismicity by over 100 km in depth, and followed by only a few small aftershocks. Globally, this is the deepest (680 km centroid depth) event with M W ≥ 7.8 in the seismological record. Seismicity indicates along-strike contortion of the Izu--Bonin slab, with horizontal flattening near a depth of 550 km in the Izu region and rapid steepening to near-vertical toward the south above the location of the 2015 event. This event was exceptionally well-recorded by seismic stations around the world, allowing detailed constraints to be placed on the source process. Analyses of a large global data set of P, SH and pP seismic phases using short-period back-projection, subevent directivity, and broadband finite-fault inversion indicate that the mainshock ruptured a shallowly-dipping fault plane with patchy slip that spread over a distance of ∼40 km with a multi-stage expansion rate ( ∼ 5 + km / s down-dip initially, ∼3 km/s up-dip later). During the 17 s total rupture duration the radiated energy was ∼ 3.3 × 10 16 J and the stress drop was ∼38 MPa. The radiation efficiency is moderate (0.34), intermediate to that of the 1994 Bolivia and 2013 Sea of Okhotsk MW 8.3 deep earthquakes, indicating that source processes of very large deep earthquakes sample a wide range of behavior from dissipative, more viscous failure to very brittle failure. The isolated occurrence of the event, much deeper than the apparently thermally-bounded distribution of Bonin-slab seismicity above 600 km depth, suggests that localized stress concentration associated with the pronounced deformation of the Izu--Bonin slab and proximity to the 660-km phase transition likely played a dominant role in generating this major earthquake.},

A wide variety of studies are consistent with an oceanic lithosphere that corresponds to a dry, chemically depleted layer over a hydrated, fertile asthenosphere. At the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary beneath oceans and many Phanerozoic continental regions, observed seismic velocity gradients require a contrast in mantle hydration, fertility, and/or melt content, perhaps in combination with a vertical gradient in velocity anisotropy. Beneath cratons, evidence is growing for a deeper?but globally ubiquitous?asthenosphere. Some studies conclude that the cratonic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is gradual enough to be matched by a purely thermal gradient, whereas others indicate a more rapid transition and a contrast in composition or perhaps melt content.},

From the analysis of the BBOBS records and a numerical finite-difference method simulation of seismic wave propagation, we elucidate the generation and propagation processes of such guided waves. We demonstrate that the low-frequency direct P and S waves propagate in the asthenosphere and that the following high-frequency, long-duration Po and So waves are developed by multiple forward scattering of P and S waves. The scattering occurs due to laterally elongated heterogeneities in both the subducting and horizontal parts of the oceanic lithosphere, with the apparent velocities (Vp = 8.1 km/s, Vs = 4.6 km/s) being close to the velocities of oceanic lithosphere.},

@article{Sereno1987,
	Abstract = {The oceanic lithosphere is an extremely efficient waveguide for high-frequency seismic energy. In particular, the propagation of the regional to teleseismic oceanic Pn and Sn phases is largely controlled by properties of the oceanic plates. The shallow velocity gradient in the sub-Moho lithosphere results in a nearly linear travel time curve for these oceanic phases and an onset velocity near the material velocity of the uppermost mantle. The confinement of Pn/Sn to the lithosphere imposes a constraint on the maximum range that a normally refracted wave can be observed. The rapid disappearance of Sn and the discontinuous drop in Pn/Sn group velocity beyond a critical distance, dependent upon the local thickness of the lithosphere, are interpreted as a shadowing effect of the low Q asthenosphere. Wave number integration was used to compute complete synthetic seismograms for a model of oceanic lithosphere. The results were compared to data collected during the 1983 Ngendei Seismic Experiment in the southwest Pacific. The Pn/Sn coda is successfully modeled as a sum of leaky organ-pipe modes in the sediment layer and oceanic water column. While scattering is present to some degree, it is not required to explain the long duration and complicated nature of the Pn/Sn wave trains. The presence of extremely high frequencies in Pn/Sn phases and the greater efficiency of Sn than Pn propagation are interpreted in terms of an absorption band rheology. A shorter high-frequency relaxation time for P waves than for S waves results in a rheology with the property that Q$\alpha$ {\textgreater} Q$\beta$ at low frequency while Q$\beta$ {\textgreater} Q$\alpha$ at high frequency, consistent with the teleseismic Pn/Sn observations. The absorption band model is to viewed as only an approximation to the true frequency dependence of Q in the oceanic lithosphere for which analytic expressions for the material dispersion have been developed.},

	Abstract = {The mantle electromagnetic and tomography (MELT) experiment found a surprising degree of asymmetry in the mantle beneath the fast-spreading, southern East Pacific Rise (MELT Seismic Team, Science 280 (1998) 1215--1218; Forsyth et al., Science 280 (1998) 1235--1238; Toomey et al., Science 280 (1998) 1224--1227; Wolfe and Solomon, Science 280 (1998) 1230--1232; Scheirer et al., Science 280 (1998) 1221--1224; Evans et al., Science 286 (1999) 752--756). Pressure-release melting of the upwelling mantle produces magma that migrates to the surface to form a layer of new crust at the spreading center about 6 km thick (Canales et al., Science 280 (1998) 1218--1221). Seismic and electromagnetic measurements demonstrated that the distribution of this melt in the mantle is asymmetric (Forsyth et al., Science 280 (1998) 1235--1238; Toomey et al., Science 280 (1998) 1224--1227; Evans et al., Science 286 (1999) 752--756) at depths of several tens of kilometers, melt is more abundant beneath the Pacific plate to the west of the axis than beneath the Nazca plate to the east. MELT investigators attributed the asymmetry in melt and geophysical properties to several possible factors: asymmetric flow passively driven by coupling to the faster moving Pacific plate; interactions between the spreading center and hotspots of the south Pacific; an off-axis center of dynamic upwelling; and/or anomalous melting of an embedded compositional heterogeneity (MELT Seismic Team, Science 280 (1998) 1215--1218; Forsyth et al., Science 280 (1998) 1235--1238; Toomey et al., Science 280 (1998) 1224--1227; Wolfe and Solomon, Science 280 (1998) 1230--1232; Evans et al., Science 286 (1999) 752--756). Here we demonstrate that passive flow driven by asymmetric plate motion alone is not a sufficient explanation of the anomalies. Asthenospheric flow from hotspots in the Pacific superswell region back to the migrating ridge axis in conjunction with the asymmetric plate motion can create many of the observed anomalies.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional images of P-wave velocity structure beneath the Hawaiian Islands, obtained from a network of seafloor and land seismometers, show an upper-mantle low-velocity anomaly that is elongated in the direction of the island chain and surrounded by a high-velocity anomaly in the shallow upper mantle that is parabolic in map view. Low velocities continue downward to the mantle transition zone between 410 and 660 km depth and extend into the topmost lower mantle, although the resolution of lower mantle structure from this data set is limited. Comparisons of inversions with separate data sets at different frequencies suggest that contamination by water reverberations is not markedly biasing the P-wave imaging of mantle structure. Many aspects of the P-wave images are consistent with independent tomographic images of S-wave velocity in the region, but there are some differences in upper mantle structure between P-wave and S-wave velocities. Inversions without station terms show a southwestward shift in the location of lowest P-wave velocities in the uppermost mantle relative to the pattern for shear waves, and inversions with station terms show differences between P-wave and S-wave velocity heterogeneity in the shallow upper mantle beneath and immediately east of the island of Hawaii. Nonetheless, the combined data sets are in general agreement with the hypothesis that the Hawaiian hotspot is the result of an upwelling, high-temperature plume. The broad upper-mantle low-velocity region beneath the Hawaiian Islands may reflect the diverging ``pancake'' at the top of the upwelling zone; the surrounding region of high velocities could represent a downwelling curtain; and the low-velocity anomalies southeast of Hawaii in the transition zone and topmost lower mantle are consistent with predictions of plume tilt.},

	Abstract = {An asthenosphere layer which is entirely fed from below by plumes and which loses equal mass by accretion to the overlying oceanic lithosphere and at subduction zones may play a critical role in shaping the form of mantle convection. In this study we discuss geochemical, seismic, and geoid/depth evidence for lateral flow within this type of asthenosphere. In particular, we suggest that there are large-scale layered, horizontal flow structures that connect upward plume input beneath hotspots to near-ridge regions of increased asthenosphere accretion into the growing oceanic lithosphere. Lateral asthenosphere flow is also shaped by oceanic subduction zones, with a partial return flow from trenches, and by deep continental roots that are migrating barriers to asthenosphere flow. This alternative paradigm offers relatively simple explanations for several puzzles about mantle convection, for example, the low mantle heat flow beneath continents. It also offers an explanation for why mid-ocean ridges appear to be passive features that migrate with little geochemical or morphological change with respect to the lower mantle and seem to be uncoupled from large-scale mantle flow, while in contrast, trenches appear to be strongly coupled to mantle-thick regions of fast (colder) seismic velocity anomalies. We also discuss several implications of this paradigm that should be testable in future studies, such as the prediction of cogenetic off-axis seamount volcanism that is created between an off-axis hotspot and its neighboring ridge axis.},

	Abstract = {Receiver functions derived from body waves recorded in Iceland and on the Hawaiian Islands reveal a seismic velocity discontinuity at about 1050 km depth beneath the two regions of presumed mantle upwelling. The waveforms of the converted phases from the mid-mantle discontinuity indicate a velocity increase with depth. The lack of consistent scattering found in recent systematic searches for seismic boundaries in the middle mantle argues against a globally continuous, sub-horizontal mineralogical phase transition near 1000 km depth. The sense of the velocity change at the mid-mantle discontinuity beneath the two hotspots is consistent with geodynamic models in which the mantle has distinct chemical reservoirs and the material beneath the compositional boundary in these areas is more silicon-rich than the overlying mantle, although the possibility of a yet-unknown phase transition particular to mantle plume material cannot be ruled out.},

In addition to a subducted slab itself, water entrained with the slab may also accumulate in the MTZ in association with stagnation. The MTZ has been thought to play a key role in the Earth's water cycle, with water transported to the MTZ possibly being released and supplied to the upper mantle to drive back-arc volcanism [e.g., Ichiki et al., 2006].},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed broadband surface wave data from ocean bottom seismometers deployed in the Shikoku Basin in the northeastern Philippine Sea to determine the radially anisotropic uppermost mantle structure beneath this oceanic basin. We first applied noise correlation method to continuous microseismic records to obtain phase velocities for fundamental-mode and first higher-mode Rayleigh waves and fundamental-mode Love waves at periods of 7--29 s. At longer periods, we applied an array analysis method to teleseismic surface waves to obtain phase velocities of fundamental-mode Rayleigh and Love waves at periods of 29--117 s. Using these broadband phase velocity measurements, we have determined the one-dimensional radially anisotropic structure from the crust to the low velocity zone (LVZ) beneath the Shikoku Basin without assuming a priori structure in the uppermost mantle. The final structural model (SB-RA10) has a high-velocity lid from the Moho to a depth of ∼40 km, with an LVZ at greater depths. S wave velocities decrease by 6{\%}--10{\%} at a depth range of ∼40--70 km. This large decrease in velocity suggests that there is either a large difference in grain size between these layers or indicates the presence of partial melt or water in the LVZ. Furthermore, strong radial anisotropy of 4{\%}--5{\%} (VSH{\textgreater}VSV) is observed in the uppermost mantle, which may be stronger in the LVZ.},

The shape of the low velocity anomaly also indicates that there is a degree of asymmetry to the thermal structure across the spreading center. The fore arc exhibits low shear velocities (Vs ∼ 3.6 km/s) at depths shallower than 40 km. These low uppermost mantle velocities are likely due to serpentinization of the fore arc. Azimuthal anisotropy results suggest an average peak-to-peak anisotropy of about 1{\%}--2{\%} with a fast direction of NNE. Fore-arc anisotropy shows arc-parallel fast directions at shallow depth in agreement with previous shear wave splitting observations and deeper arc-perpendicular directions influenced by the slab. Back-arc anisotropy is largely arc perpendicular, consistent with splitting observations west of the spreading center.},

	Abstract = {A long-term seismic array observation was conducted around the North Mariana island arc using 10 long-term ocean bottom seismometer (LTOBS), which gathered data for one year starting in 2001 October. The purpose of the observation was to research the deep seismic activity and the structure of the Mariana subduction system. By using data from nine of the LTOBS, which covered about 11 months of elapsed time, more than 3000 local events were found through the hypocentre determination with a one-dimensional velocity model. Only 59 of these events were listed in the same period on the US National Earthquake Information Centre's Preliminary Determination of Epicentres (PDE) publication. The hypocentres with small determination errors clearly show a double seismic zone (DSZ) reaching 150 km in depth with two seismic planes separated by about 30 km. The extension of the DSZ's seismic activity remains high until a depth of about 270 km. In the backarc basin, some shallow seismic activities were found as linear foci around the current ridge axis. High seismic activity was also recorded to the north and the west of a large serpentine seamount in the forearc. In addition, a zone almost devoid of earthquakes exists in the upper plane of the DSZ with the low velocity of the P phase (VP) region modelled by an inversion. This region looks like a narrow channel running east to west. A shear wave splitting study of the area indicates a change of splitting direction near the southern edge of this channel. A result of a gravity study also shows negative gravity anomalies in the same area. This region could be a serpentinized forearc mantle with water supplied to it from a seamount that was in the past carried downwards with the subducting Pacific Plate.},

	Abstract = {The anelastic structure of a subduction zone can place first-order constraints on variations in temperature and volatile content. We investigate seismic attenuation across the western Pacific Mariana subduction system using data from the 2003--2004 Mariana Subduction Factory Imaging Experiment. This 11-month experiment consisted of 20 broadband stations deployed on the arc islands and 58 semibroadband ocean bottom seismographs deployed across the fore arc, island arc, and back-arc spreading center. We compute amplitude spectra for P and S arrivals from local earthquakes and invert for the path-averaged attenuation for each waveform along with the seismic moment and corner frequency for each earthquake. Additionally, we investigate earthquake source parameter assumptions and frequency-dependent exponents ($\alpha$) ranging from 0 to 0.6. Tomographic inversion of nearly 3000 t* estimates (at $\alpha$ = 0.27) for 2-D QP−1 and QP/QS structure shows a ∼75 km wide columnar-shaped high-attenuation anomaly with QP ∼ 43--60 beneath the spreading center that extends from the uppermost mantle to ∼100 km depth. A weaker high-attenuation region (QP ∼ 56--70) occurs at depths of 50--100 km beneath the volcanic arc, and the high-attenuation regions are connected at depths of 75--125 km. The subducting Pacific plate is characterized by low attenuation at depths greater than 100 km, but high attenuation is found in the plate between 50 and 100 km depth. The fore arc shows high attenuation near the volcanic arc and beneath the serpentinite seamounts in the outer fore arc. QS structure is less well resolved than QP because of a smaller data set, but QP/QS ratios are significantly less than 2 throughout the study region. As temperatures estimated from QS−1 are unusually high, we interpret the arc and wedge core anomalies as regions of high temperature with enhanced Q−1 due to hydration and/or melt, the slab and fore-arc anomalies as indicative of slab-derived fluids and/or large-scale serpentinization, and the columnar-shaped high QP−1 anomaly directly beneath the back-arc spreading center as indicative of a narrow region of dynamic upwelling and melt production beneath the slow spreading ridge axis.},

	Abstract = {A double zone of seismicity has been found beneath the northern Marianas in the depth range 80--120 km. The Benioff zone undergoes a pronounced bend, with radius of curvature about 200 km, before straightening and descending nearly vertically to a depth of more than 600 km. Thus this is an ideal area in which to search for evidence of stresses associated with unbending of the subducted oceanic plate. We relocated all teleseismic events from 1963 through 1975 by using a regional, composite master event technique, which significantly decreased the scatter of the hypocenters. The three events of the lower seismic zone are separated from the upper zone by about 30--35 km. The true thickness of the upper seismic zone is probably 20 km or less. The limited focal mechanism data indicate that there is downdip tension in the lower zone and downdip compression in the upper zone. The seismicity patterns could be generated either by thermal stresses or by unbending a plate which was originally deformed anelastically. We show that an elastic-perfectly plastic model of the rheology of the plate can account for the separation of the two seismic zones, the focal mechanisms, and the greater activity of the upper seismic zone.},

	Abstract = {Characteristics of seismicity at intermediate depth beneath the Tonga arc are studied. Special attention is paid to newly identified downdip tensional events because the dominance of downdip compression has been known in this area. We reexamine the relatively shallow ({\textless}70 km) downdip tensional events, reported in the Harvard centroid moment tensor solutions, by modeling bodywave waveforms of World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network seismograms and conclude that they are in fact intraplate downdip tensional events. Furthermore, these downdip tensional events are consistently located below and seaward of downdip compressional events and appear to constitute a double seismic zone. The result of a relative relocation technique applied to these earthquakes also supports this observation, which was originally based on routinely determined epicenters. The subducting slab beneath the Tonga arc has been considered as a prototype of a compressionally loaded slab. The existence of a double seismic zone in Tonga, therefore, would suggest that double seismic zones, located at intermediate depth in subducting slabs, are more common than previously thought.},

	Abstract = {Dehydration embrittlement of metamorphosed oceanic crust and mantle in the subducting slab may be responsible for the occurrence of intermediate-depth earthquakes. We explore the possibility that this hypothesis can explain the morphology of the double seismic zones observed in northeast Japan, southwest Japan, northeast Taiwan, northern Chile, Cape Mendocino, and eastern Aleutians. We calculate transient temperature structures of slabs based on geologically estimated subduction histories of these regions. We then determine dehydration loci of metamorphosed oceanic crust and serpentinized mantle using experimentally derived phase diagrams. The depth range of the dehydration loci of metamorphosed oceanic crust and serpentine is dependent on slab age. The dehydration loci of serpentine produce a double-layered structure. Because the upper dehydration loci of serpentine are mostly located in the wedge mantle above the slab, we regard the upper plane seismicity representing dehydration embrittlement in the oceanic crust, and we fix the slab geometry so that the upper plane seismicity is just below the upper surface of the slab. We find that the lower plane seismicity is located at the lower dehydration loci of serpentine, which indicates that the morphology of the double seismic zones is consistent with the dehydration embrittlement.},

@article{Karato1998,
	Abstract = {The common belief that the seismic low velocity and high attenuation zone (the asthenosphere) is caused by the presence of a small amount of melt is not supported by recent mineral physics and seismological observations. A review of recent mineral physics observations suggests that water significantly reduces seismic wave velocities through anelastic relaxation and hence, at a small melt fraction expected in most of the Earth's upper mantle, partial melting will increase seismic wave velocities through the removal of water from minerals such as olivine. Therefore the asthenosphere, in this model, is a layer where no significant partial melting occurs and hence a high water content is retained. We apply this model to calculate seismic wave velocities and attenuation in the upper mantle with a range of water contents. The seismic structures calculated from this model depend on geotherm, the mode of partial melting (batch or fractional melting) and the geometry of upwelling flow (passive flow or dynamic upwelling). The sharp velocity change around 60--80 km (the Gutenberg discontinuity) can be attributed to a sharp change in water content due to partial melting, if the temperature there is relatively high as implied by the plate model and if melting occurs as fractional melting but not by batch melting. However, the significant increase in seismic wave velocity with age in young oceanic upper mantle suggests rapid cooling as predicted by a cooling half-space model. Thus, the present model suggests fast cooling in the early stage but slow cooling in the later stage of evolution of the oceanic upper mantle, the latter being caused presumably by some additional heat in the old oceanic upper mantle. The seismic structures of typical oceanic upper mantle with a fast spreading rate (e.g., the Pacific) is consistent with passive spreading, whereas the greater depth of the G-discontinuity and the weaker seismic anisotropy in back-arc regions (e.g., the Philippine Sea) suggest dynamic upwelling caused presumably by a higher degree of melting due to a larger amount of water.},

@article{Hirth1996,
	Abstract = {The influence of water on the dynamics of the oceanic upper mantle is re-evaluated based on recent experimental constraints on the solubility of water in mantle minerals and earlier experimental studies of olivine rheology. Experimental results indicate that the viscosity of olivine aggregates is reduced by a factor of ∼ 140 in the presence of water at a confining pressure of 300 MPa and that the influence of water on viscosity depends on the concentration of water in olivine. The water content of olivine in the MORB source is estimated to be810$\pm$490H10/6 Si, a value greater than the solubility of water in olivine at a confining pressure of 300 MPa (∼ 250H10/6 Si). We therefore conclude that the viscosity of the mantle in the MORB source region is 500$\pm$300 times less than that of dry olivine aggregates. The dependence of the solubility of water in olivine on pressure and water fugacity is used in conjunction with other petrological constraints to estimate the depth at which melting initiates beneath mid-ocean ridges. These calculations indicate that melting begins at a depth of ∼ 115 km, consistent with other geochemical observations. Owing to the relatively small amount of water present in the MORB source, only ∼ 1--2{\%} melt is produced in the depth interval between the water-influenced solidus and the dry solidus. A discontinuity in mantle viscosity can develop at a depth of ∼ 60--70 km as a result of the extraction of water from olivine during the MORB melting process. In the mid-ocean ridge environment, the mantle viscosity at depths above this discontinuity may be large enough to produce lateral pressure gradients capable of focusing melt migration to the ridge axis. These observations indicate that the base of an oceanic plate is defined by a compositional rather than thermal boundary layer, or at least that the location of the thermal boundary layer is strongly influenced by a compositional boundary, and that the evolution of the oceanic upper mantle is strongly influenced by a viscosity structure that is controlled by the extraction of water from olivine at mid-ocean ridges.},

	Abstract = {A high-resolution image of the base of the lithosphere from S-to-P converted seismic waves revealed the collision architecture of the Indian and Asian continental plates beneath the Tibetan Plateau. The base of the Indian lithosphere dips northward from a depth of 160 km beneath the Himalayas to a depth of 220 km just south of the Bangong suture. The base of the Asian lithosphere is nearly horizontal at the depth of 160--180 km from central to northern Tibet. There is a vertical gap of about 50 km between Indian and Asian lithospheres. Our observation of a well-defined, thick lithosphere throughout the entire plateau is not consistent with models of wholesale convective instability of a thickened mantle lithosphere, which would predict a very thin Asian lithosphere. The hypothesized sequential southward subduction of Tibetan and Asian continental lithospheres leading to the growth of the Tibetan Plateau, if correct, cannot be occurring below ∼180 km depth. Our results, along with available geological and geophysical data, strongly support that the plateau is predominantly formed by a relatively coherent north dipping subducted Indian continental lithosphere in the south, which presently can be traced to the middle of the plateau, and a south dipping subducted Asian lithosphere in the north at a shallower depth.},

	Abstract = {Plate tectonics is based on the concept of rigid lithosphere plates sliding on a mechanically weak asthenosphere. Many models assume that the weakness of the asthenosphere is related to the presence of small amounts of hydrous melts. However, the mechanism that may cause melting in the asthenosphere is not well understood. We show that the asthenosphere coincides with a zone where the water solubility in mantle minerals has a pronounced minimum. The minimum is due to a sharp decrease of water solubility in aluminous orthopyroxene with depth, whereas the water solubility in olivine continuously increases with pressure. Melting in the asthenosphere may therefore be related not to volatile enrichment but to a minimum in water solubility, which causes excess water to form a hydrous silicate melt.},

@article{Nishimura1989,
	Abstract = {Anisotropic inversions of surface wave data show that the variations in vertical shear velocity, $\beta$v, and anisotropy of the oceanic upper mantle in the Pacific are much smoother and more systematic functions of the age of the seafloor than has been reported in previous studies. The data used in this analysis are the pure-path results of previous studies on the lateral distribution of fundamental-mode Love and Rayleigh wave phase velocities (Nishimura {\&} Forsyth 1985, 1988). The pure-path models include parameters which describe the variations with age, azimuthal anisotropy and residual depth anomalies. The calculated velocity models of the upper mantle are constrained to vary smoothly with depth and to represent the minimum deviation from an isotropic starting model. Inversions were performed using the method of Tarantola {\&} Valette (1982).The two best resolved parameters of the computed transversely isotropic model are the shear wave velocity terms, $\beta$v and $\xi$. The results indicate that $\beta$v above 200 km progressively increases as a function of the age of the seafloor with the pattern qualitatively mimicking isotherms of theoretical thermal cooling models. If one selects the depth to the maximum negative gradient in shear velocity as being the best available indicator of lithospheric thickness, then the thickness increases from about 15--35 km beneath 0--4 Myr old seafloor to 70--110 km in the oldest seafloor. The magnitude of the shear wave anisotropy term, $\xi$, rapidly increases in the first 20 Myr until some apparent constant value is reached in the older regions. A more realistic upper mantle structure is calculated using a priori information on the correlation between changes in shear and compressional wave velocities and the expected nature of the anisotropy. The general results are the same as the previous inversion without a priori constraints. Finally, the effect of attenuation is included, the primary result being an overall increase in $\beta$v. The maximum change occurs at around 150 km depth, which reduces the velocity contrast between the lithosphere and asthenosphere. It is therefore more difficult to make a distinction between the plate and low-velocity zone when the effect of attenuation is included.An estimate of the azimuthal anisotropic structure is obtained by inverting for the Rayleigh wave cos 2$\psi$ coefficients using derivatives calculated by the method of Montagner {\&} Nataf (1986). The reference frame used to constrain the azimuthal effect is that of fossil seafloor spreading direction. The results indicate that in regions of the Pacific less than 80 Myr in age, there is significant anisotropy down to 200 km depth. In regions older than 80 Myr, azimuthal anisotropy is confined to the upper 50 km. The transverse and azimuthal anisotropy structures can be explained by an oceanic upper mantle containing olivine with different orientations.},

We incorporate crustal thickness perturbations as model parameters in the inversions to properly consider crustal effects and suppress the leakage of crustal structure into mantle structure. This is possible since we utilize short-period group-velocity data with a period range down to 16 s, which are strongly sensitive to the crust. The isotropic S velocity model shares common features with previous global S velocity models and shows excellent consistency with several high-resolution upper mantle models. Our anisotropic model also agrees well with previous regional studies. Anomalous features in our anisotropic model are faster SV velocity anomalies along subduction zones at transition zone depths and faster SH velocity beneath slabs in the lower mantle. The derived crustal thickness perturbations also bring potentially important information about the crustal thickness beneath oceanic crusts, which has been difficult to constrain due to poor access compared with continental crusts.},

When combined with constraints from mineral physics and geodynamics, anisotropy provides critical information on the geometry of mantle flow. Here we review the theory, early work, recent tomographic models, and experimental constraints on radial anisotropy. We discuss current challenges in resolving radial anisotropy seismically. In particular, we show that it is highly beneficial to use multiple datasets in inversions for anisotropy, notably short-period group velocity data with strong sensitivity to the crust. We present a new whole-mantle model of radial anisotropy, based on surface-wave and body-wave travel time data, along with incorporated Moho perturbations. Our whole-mantle model shares common features with previous global models and is consistent with results from several high-resolution regional studies.},

	Abstract = {The first comprehensive seismic experiment sampling subridge mantle revealed a pronounced low-velocity zone between 40 and 100 km depth below the East Pacific Rise (EPR) that has been attributed to substantial retained melt fractions of 0.3--2{\%}. Such high melt fractions are at odds with low melt productivity and high melt mobility inferred from petrology and geochemistry. Here, we evaluate whether seismic attenuation can reconcile subridge seismic structure with low melt fractions. We start from a dynamic spreading model which includes melt generation and migration and is converted into seismic structure, accounting for temperature-, pressure-, composition-, phase-, and melt-dependent anharmonicity, and temperature-, pressure-, frequency- and hydration-dependent anelasticity. Our models predict a double low-velocity zone: a shallow---approximately triangular---region due to dry melting, and a low-velocity channel between 60 and 150 km depth dominantly controlled by solid state high-temperature seismic attenuation in a damp mantle, with only a minor contribution of ({\textless}0.1{\%}) melt. We test how tomographic inversion influences the imaging of our modeled shear velocity features. The EPR experiment revealed a double low-velocity zone, but most tomographic studies would only resolve the deeper velocity minimum. Experimentally constrained anelasticity formulations produce VSas low as observed and can explain lateral variations in near-ridge asthenospheric VS with $\pm$100 K temperature variations and/or zero to high water content. Furthermore, such QS formulations also reproduce low asthenospheric VS below older oceans and continents from basic lithospheric cooling models. Although these structures are compatible with global QS images, they are more attenuating than permitted by EPR data.},

	Abstract = {The crustal and lithospheric structure of the normal oceanic plates is investigated using converted wave techniques (P and S receiver functions (RFs) and novel stacking analysis techniques without deconvolution) applied to the data from two seafloor borehole broadband seismic stations located in the central Philippine Sea and in the northwest Pacific ocean. We observe sufficient energy from at least two discontinuities within the error bounds, one from the crust-mantle (Moho) boundary and the other from the seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). Synthetic seismograms for seafloor stations show that the water reverberations interfere with the vertical component of seismograms but to a lesser extent with the radial part of P receiver functions. On the other hand, S receiver functions are devoid of such effects since all the multiples and converted waves are separated in time by the primary S wave in time. Waveform modeling of RFs shows that the crustal thicknesses of the western Philippine Sea plate and northwest Pacific plate are ∼7--8 km, and that depths of LAB are 76 $\pm$ 1.8 km and 82 $\pm$ 4.4 km, respectively, with an abrupt Vs drop at LAB of ∼7{\%}--8{\%}, as reported by Kawakatsu et al. (2009). The LAB depth for the eastern Philippine plate is found to be ∼55 km. To confirm the robustness of this observation, we further analyze vertical and radial components of the data without deconvolution for P wave backscattered reflection phases and P-to-S converted phases. The result indicates that the reflected/converted phases from Moho and LAB are observed at timings consistent with the receiver function results. The effect of seismic anisotropy for observed RFs is also investigated.},

	Abstract = {Observations of seismic anisotropy at oceanic spreading centres offer insights into mid-ocean ridge processes and the formation of new plates. Here, remote observations of seismic anisotropy beneath mid-ocean ridges are made using measurements of source-side shear wave splitting. Over 100 high-quality measurements are made using earthquakes that occur near mid-ocean ridges and transform faults, but are observed at teleseismic distances. In general, for off-axis ridge events, the polarisation of fast shear waves, ϕ″, is approximately parallel to the spreading direction. Nearer the ridge ( {\textless} {\~{}} 50 km), ϕ″ becomes more scattered and is often ridge-parallel. Delay times, $\delta$t, tend to increase from {\textless} 1 s near the ridge axis to ∼ 3 s further away. Slow-spreading regions (Gakkel and Southwest Indian Ridges) show smaller amounts of splitting than faster spreading centres. At transform zones, the pattern is more complex. Coverage beneath the East Pacific Rise is especially good, and we observe a systematic increase in delay times in S wave splitting measurements compared to previous SKS splitting observations made at ocean-bottom seismometers. One compatible explanation is the presence of horizontally-aligned, connected layers of melt at depth; this is also compatible with other observations of the `LAB' discontinuity and surface-wave derived measurements of radial anisotropy.},

	Abstract = {We examine upper mantle anisotropy across the Hawaiian Swell by analyzing shear wave splitting of teleseismic SKSwaves recorded by the PLUME broadband land and ocean bottom seismometer deployments. Mantle anisotropy beneath the oceans is often attributed to flow-induced lattice-preferred orientation of olivine. Splitting observations may reflect a combination of both fossil lithospheric anisotropy and anisotropy due to present-day asthenospheric flow, and here we address the question whether splitting provides diagnostic information on possible asthenospheric plume flow at Hawaii. We find that the splitting fast directions are coherent and predominantly parallel to the fossil spreading direction, suggesting that shear wave splitting dominantly reflects fossil lithospheric anisotropy. The signature of anisotropy from asthenospheric flow is more subtle, although it could add some perturbation to lithospheric splitting. The measured delay times are typically 1 s or less, although a few stations display larger splitting delays of 1--2 s. The variability in the delay times across the different stations indicates differences in the degree of anisotropy or in the thickness of the anisotropic layer or in the effect of multilayer anisotropy. Regions with smaller splitting times may have experienced processes that modified the lithosphere and partially erased the fossil anisotropy; alternatively, asthenospheric splitting may either constructively add to or destructively subtract from lithospheric splitting to produce the observed variability in delay times.},

	Abstract = {Oceanic lithosphere constitutes the bulk of Earth's tectonic plates and also likely represents the building blocks of the continental lithosphere. The depth and nature of the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary are central to our understanding of the definition of the tectonic plates and lithospheric evolution. Although it is well established that oceanic lithosphere cools, thickens, and subsides as it ages according to conductive cooling models, this relatively simple realization of the tectonic plates is not completely understood. Old ({\textgreater}70 Ma) ocean depths are shallower than predicted. Furthermore, precise imaging of the lower boundary of the oceanic lithosphere has proven challenging. Here we directly map the depth and nature of a seismic discontinuity that is likely the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary across the Pacific plate using a new method that models variations in the shapes of stacked SS waveforms from 17 years of seismic data. The depth to the discontinuity varies from 25 to 130 km and correlates with distance from the ridge along mantle flow lines. This implies that the depth of the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary depends on the temperature of the underlying asthenosphere, defined by a best fitting isotherm at 930$\,^{\circ}$C with a 95{\%} confidence region of 820--1020$\,^{\circ}$C, although the sharpness of the observations in some locations implies a mechanism besides temperature may also be required.},

	Abstract = {Azimuthal anisotropy is the dependence of local seismic properties on the azimuth of propagation. We present the azimuthally anisotropic component of a 3D SV velocity model for the Pacific Ocean, derived from the waveform modeling of over 56,000 multi-mode Rayleigh waves followed by a simultaneous inversion for isotropic and azimuthally anisotropic vsv structure. The isotropic vsv model is discussed in a previous paper (A. Maggi, E. Debayle, K. Priestley, G. Barruol, Multi-mode surface waveform tomography of the Pacific Ocean: a close look at the lithospheric cooling signature, Geophys. J. Int. 166 (3) (2006). doi:10.1111/j.1365-246x.2006.03037.x). The azimuthal anisotropy we find is consistent with the lattice preferred orientation model (LPO): the hypothesis of anisotropy generation in the Earth's mantle by preferential alignment of anisotropic crystals in response to the shear strains induced by mantle flow. At lithospheric depths we find good agreement between fast azimuthal anisotropy orientations and ridge spreading directions recorded by sea-floor magnetic anomalies. At asthenospheric depths we find a strong correlation between fast azimuthal anisotropy orientations and the directions of current plate motions. We observe perturbations in the pattern of seismic anisotropy close to Pacific hot-spots that are consistent with the predictions of numerical models of LPO generation in plume-disturbed plate motion-driven mantle flow. These observations suggest that perturbations in the patterns of azimuthal anisotropy may provide indirect evidence for plume-like upwelling in the mantle.},

@article{Anderson1995,
	Abstract = {``Lithosphere'' is a mechanical concept implying strength and relative permanence. Unfortunately, the term has also been applied to the surface thermal boundary layer (TBL) and a shallow enriched geochemical reservoir, features having nothing to do with strength. The ``strong'' lithosphere is about one half the thickness of the TBL. The bottom of the elastic plate, the maximum depths of midplate and fracture zone earthquakes, and the top of the low-velocity zone all occur at depths corresponding to the 550$\,^{\circ}$--750$\,^{\circ}$C temperature range. This may also correspond to the base of the coherent plate. Earthquakes in subducted slabs are bounded by isotherms in this temperature interval. Mantle hotter than ∼650$\,^{\circ}$C cannot support long-term stresses and does not qualify as lithosphere. There is very little ancient lithosphere (mantle colder than 650 $\pm$ 100$\,^{\circ}$C for long periods of time), and this is not a suitable reservoir for continental flood basalts (CFB). A chemical characteristic, that is, ``enriched,'' has been attributed to old lithosphere to distinguish it from the ``depleted'' upper mantle. The continental lithosphere (CL) is often treated as a viable reservoir for CFB or, when delaminated, for ocean island basalts and enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). The CFB reservoir is more likely to be a hot, weak sublithospheric layer which may include the lower part of the TBL. The term ``perisphere'' has been introduced to accommodate the need for a term for a global, shallow, enriched reservoir or boundary layer. It is physically isolated from the depleted mantle (usually called the ``convecting mantle,'' ``asthenosphere'' or ``upper mantle'') not by its strength but by its weakness and buoyancy; it is chemically isolated by its location relative to subduction recycling. It has the chemical characteristics often attributed to continental lithosphere (or plume heads), but it is a permanent part of the sublithospheric shallow mantle and is constantly refreshed by recycling. It is an open system and can also be called the ``active layer'' or ``mixing zone.'' It is proposed that the depleted reservoir (MORB source or depleted mantle) is below and protected from contamination (chemical isolation) by the filtering action of this boundary layer. Depleted MORB is most prominent at fast spreading ridges, which induce or localize deep, broad upwellings. Melts from enriched mantle (EM) are most evident at new or slowly rifting regions, infant subduction zones, new backarc basins, slab windows, and mid-plate environments away from spreading induced upwelling. EM is therefore probably shallow. It is not known if volatiles and large-ion lithophiles can recycle much deeper than ∼200 km, or into the lower mantle, as is implied by some plume theories. The base of the (strong) lithosphere and plate may correspond to a phase change. If so, the correspondence among the brittle-ductile boundary (the maximum depth of earthquakes), the top of the low-velocity zone, and the elastic plate thickness can be understood. Candidate phase changes include dehydration and clinoenstatite to orthoenstatite since these occur near 600$\,^{\circ}$C. Another rheological boundary may set in near the solidus, but silicates lose most of their strength at absolute temperatures about one half the dry solidus temperature. The region of the subcontinental mantle between ∼600$\,^{\circ}$C and the solidus may provide some of the material in continental magmas, but this cannot be considered part of the continental plate. The ``continental lithosphere'' reservoir of petrologists is actually a weak enriched layer that may spread across the top of the convecting mantle. This is the perisphere. Its existence makes it possible to understand CFB and ocean island chemistry and kinematics without postulating plumes from the lower mantle, plume heads, fossil plume heads, or delaminated CL. The upper mantle is inhomogeneous in chemistry.},

	Abstract = {The cross correlation of ambient signal allows seismologists to collect data even in the absence of seismic events. ``Seismic interferometry'' shows that the cross correlation of simultaneous recordings of a random wavefield made at two locations is formally related to the impulse response between those locations. This idea has found many applications in seismology, as a growing number of dense seismic networks become available: cross-correlating long seismic records, the Green's function between instrument pairs is ``reconstructed'' and used, just like the seismic recording of an explosion, in tomography, monitoring, etc. These applications have been accompanied by theoretical investigations of the relationship between noise cross correlation and the Green's function; numerous formulations of ``ambient noise'' theory have emerged, each based on different hypotheses and/or analytical approaches. The purpose of this study is to present most of those approaches together, providing a comprehensive overview of the theory. Understanding the specific hypotheses behind each Green's function recipe is critical to its correct application. Hoping to guide nonspecialists who approach ambient noise theory for the first time, we treat the simplest formulation (the stationary-phase approximation applied to smooth unbounded media) in detail. We then move on to more general treatments, illustrating that the ``stationary-phase'' and ``reciprocity theorem'' approaches lead to the same formulae when applied to the same scenario. We show that a formal cross correlation/Green's function relationship can be found in complex, bounded media and for nonuniform source distributions. We finally provide the bases for understanding how the Green's function is reconstructed in the presence of scattering obstacles.},

This diversity requires different approaches to mitigate hazards. In certain tectonic environments, seismologists can forecast the future occurrence of large earthquakes within a solid scientific framework using the results from seismology and GPS. Such forecasts are critically important for long-term hazard mitigation practices, but because stochastic fracture processes are complex, the forecasts are inevitably subject to large uncertainty, and unexpected events will continue to surprise seismologists. Recent developments in real-time seismology will help seismologists to cope with and prepare for tsunamis and earthquakes. Combining a better understanding of earthquake diversity with modern technology is the key to effective and comprehensive hazard mitigation practices.},

	Abstract = {W phase is a long period phase arriving before S wave. It can be interpreted as superposition of the fundamental, first, second and third overtones of spheroidal modes or Rayleigh waves and has a group velocity from 4.5 to 9 km s−1 over a period range of 100--1000 s. The amplitude of long period waves better represents the tsunami potential of an earthquake. Because of the fast group velocity of W phase, most of W phase energy is contained within a short time window after the arrival of the P wave. At a distance of 50$\,^{\circ}$, W phase energy is contained within 23 min after the origin time which is the distinct advantage of using W phase for rapid tsunami warning purposes. We use a time domain deconvolution method to extract W phases from the broad-band records of global seismic networks. The bandwidth of W phase is approximately from 0.001 to 0.01 Hz, and we bandpass filter the data from 0.001 to 0.005 Hz in most cases. Having extracted W phase from the vertical component records, we perform a linear inversion using a point source to determine Mw and the source mechanism for several large earthquakes including the 2004 Sumatra--Andaman earthquake, the 2005 Nias earthquake, the 2006 Kuril Is. earthquake and the 2007 Sumatra earthquake. W phase inversion yields reliable solutions and holds promise of the use of W phase for rapid assessment of tsunami potential.},

Abstract?Real-time seismology refers to a practice in which seismic data are collected and analyzed quickly after a significant seismic event, so that the results can be effectively used for postearthquake emergency response and early warning. As the technology of seismic instrumentation, telemetry, computers, and data storage facility advances, the real-time seismology for rapid postearthquake notification is essentially established. Research for early warning is still underway. Two approaches are possible: (a) regional warning and (b) on-site (or site-specific) warning. In (a), the traditional seismological method is used to locate an earthquake, determine the magnitude, and estimate the ground motion at other sites. In (b), the beginning of the ground motion (mainly P wave) observed at a site is used to predict the ensuing ground motion at the same site. An effective approach to on-site warning is discussed in light of earthquake rupture physics.},

	Abstract = {The recent Nicaragua tsunami earthquake (September 2, 1992) produced a distinct ramp-like long-period (up to 1000 sec) phase which begins between P and S waves on displacement seismograms. In terms of ray theory, this phase consists of long-period P, PP, S, SS, SP, PS, etc and its propagation mechanism is similar to that of a whispering gallery. In terms of normal-mode theory, it represents a group of higher-mode Rayleigh waves with a group velocity close to, but slower than, that of P wave. This phase has not been recognized as a distinct phase in the seismological practice because of clipping of seismograms for very large earthquakes. With the advent of modern wide-dynamic range seismographs, this phase can be easily identified for all large earthquakes. In view of its use for identifying slow earthquakes, determining whether slow deformation is precursory or coseismic to the regular short-period energy release, and determining velocity structures between the source and the station, we propose that this phase be called the ``W phase''.},

	Abstract = {A surface wave dispersion data set of unprecedented size is used to obtain a variable-resolution model of the radially anisotropic shear wave velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath North America and globally. Love and Rayleigh wave phase velocities for periods in the range 35--150 s constrain a three-dimensional model of velocity variations on a length scale of a few hundred kilometers within the North American continent and a few thousand kilometers globally. The short- and long-wavelength models are determined simultaneously. Long-period surface wave phase velocities (200--350 s) are used to help constrain longer-wavelength and transition zone structure. Laterally varying velocity sensitivity kernels are used to account for the dependence of the velocity sensitivity on lateral variations in crust and mantle velocity structure. The sensitivity kernels are updated in several iterations to avoid nonlinearities associated with the inverse problem for the determination of mantle structure. Variations in isotropic velocity in the uppermost several hundred kilometers of the mantle are found to correlate well with surface tectonic features. Within the North American craton, the locations of strongest radial anisotropy generally correlate with the locations of fastest isotropic velocity. Variations in radial anisotropy show a clear continent-ocean signature. Strong anisotropy occurs at shallow depths ({\textless}100 km) under the continents, with a secondary peak found at a depth of ∼200 km. Maximum anisotropy under the oceans occurs at a depth of ∼125 km, with no secondary maximum. Combined interpretation of isotropic and anisotropic continent-ocean differences suggests a different role for the low-velocity zone under continental and oceanic regions.},

	Abstract = {The dispersion of Love and Rayleigh waves in the period range 17--167 s is used to detect the change in the structure of the upper mantle as the age of the sea-floor increases away from the mid-ocean ridge. Using the single station method, the group and phase velocities of Rayleigh waves were measured for 78 paths in the east Pacific. In order to describe the observed Rayleigh wave dispersion, both a systematic increase in velocities with the age of the sea-floor and anisotropy of propagation are required. The maximum change in velocity with age is about 5 per cent, with the contrast between age zones decreasing with increasing period. The greatest change occurs in the first few million years, due to the rapid cooling and solidification of the upper part of the lithosphere. In the 0--5 My age zone, the average thickness of the lithosphere can be no greater than 30 km, including the water and crustal layers. Within 10 My after formation, the lithosphere reaches a thickness of about 60 km. As the mantle continues to cool, the shear velocity within the lithosphere increases. Within the area of this study, no change occurs in the upper mantle deeper than about 80 km.Rayleigh waves travel fastest in the direction of spreading. The degree of anisotropy in Rayleigh wave propagation is frequency-dependent, reaching a maximum of 2{\textperiodcentered}0$\pm$0{\textperiodcentered}2 per cent at a period of about 70 s. Several models are constructed which can reproduce this frequency-dependent anisotropy.The regional phase velocities of the fundamental and first higher Love modes have been simultaneously measured using a new technique. The Love wave data is inconsistent with the Rayleigh wave data unless SH velocity is higher than SV velocity within the uppermost 125 km of the mantle. Anisotropy deeper than 250 km is suggested, but not required, by the data.},

The largest number of robust reflections comes from a depth of 220 km, which we associate with the Lehmann discontinuity. This discontinuity is observed below both continental and oceanic areas, though the largest amplitudes appear beneath the continents. There is also evidence for weak discontinuities at approximately 260 and 310 km depth. The regions where we find the Lehmann discontinuity, in a global search, correspond to regions where local studies have found reflectors at similar depth. There are suggestions of lower mantle reflectors, in particular in the Indonesian subduction zone area where other studies have found similar reflections.},

We analyzed 15 years of global seismic data using P-to-S (Ps) converted phases and imaged an interface that correlates with tectonic environment, varying from 95 $\pm$ 4 kilometers beneath Precambrian shields and platforms to 81 $\pm$ 2 kilometers beneath tectonically altered regions and 70 $\pm$ 4 kilometers at oceanic island stations. High-frequency Ps observations require a sharp discontinuity; therefore, this interface likely represents a boundary in composition, melting, or anisotropy, not temperature alone. It likely represents the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary under oceans and tectonically altered regions, but it may constitute another boundary in cratonic regions where the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is thought to be much deeper.},

	Abstract = {A horizontally layered inhomogeneous medium, isotropic or transversely isotropic, is considered, whose properties are constant or nearly so when averaged over some vertical height l′. For waves longer than l′ the medium is shown to behave like a homogeneous, or nearly homogeneous, transversely isotropic medium whose density is the average density and whose elastic coefficients are algebraic combinations of averages of algebraic combinations of the elastic coefficients of the original medium. The nearly homogeneous medium is said to be `long-wave equivalent' to the original medium. Conditions on the five elastic coefficients of a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium are derived which are necessary and sufficient for the medium to be `long-wave equivalent' to a horizontally layered isotropic medium. Further conditions are also derived which are necessary and sufficient for the homogeneous medium to be `long-wave equivalent' to a horizontally layered isotropic medium consisting of only two different homogeneous isotropic materials. Except in singular cases, if the latter two-layered medium exists at all, its proportions and elastic coefficients are uniquely determined by the elastic coefficients of the homogeneous transversely isotropic medium. The observed variations in crustal P-wave velocity with depth, obtained from well logs, are shown to be large enough to explain some of the observed crustal anisotropies as due to layering of isotropic material.},

	Abstract = {Pn is the high-frequency, scattered P phase guided for great distances within the old oceanic lithosphere. Two arrays of ocean bottom seismometers were deployed on old (150--160 Ma) seafloor in the northwestern Pacific south of Shatsky Rise for the Pacific Lithosphere Anisotropy and Thickness Experiment. We use Pn phases from 403 earthquakes during the 1 year of deployment to measure apparent velocities across the arrays. Each array was deployed on a separate limb of a magnetic bight, formed near a fast-spreading, ridge-ridge-ridge triple junction. Using high-frequency waves (5--10 Hz), we look at variations of Pn velocities as a function of azimuth. In the western array, we find Pn anisotropy with velocities ranging from {\~{}}8.7 km/s in the back azimuth ($\theta$) direction of 310$\,^{\circ}$ to {\~{}}7.7 km/s at {\~{}}350$\,^{\circ}$. In the eastern array, the velocity ranges from {\~{}}8.5 km/s in back azimuth direction of {\~{}}210$\,^{\circ}$ to {\~{}}7.7 km/s at 260$\,^{\circ}$ and {\~{}}310$\,^{\circ}$. We observe rapid velocity changes with azimuth in the both arrays requiring sinusoidal variations of roughly equal amplitude as a function of both 2$\theta$ and 4$\theta$, which is not expected for the orthorhombic symmetry of olivine or orthopyroxene. The fastest directions on the two limbs are roughly orthogonal to each other suggesting the dominance of fossil anisotropy, but the fast directions of the 2$\theta$ components are skewed counterclockwise from the spreading directions. We speculate that the rapid azimuthal variations may be caused by vertical stratification with changing anisotropy with depth in the oceanic lithosphere.},

	Abstract = {The Pacific Lithosphere Anisotropy and Thickness Experiment ocean bottom seismometer array south of the Shatsky Rise allows imaging the attenuation structure of the upper mantle in the oldest parts of the Pacific Ocean. The array consisted of eight seismometers with a lateral extent of 200 km by 600 km. Intermediate- and deep-focus earthquake sources in the Mariana and Izu-Bonin subduction zones provide paths that probe different depths beneath the seafloor. Acceleration spectra from the vertical component of P waves are inverted for the attenuation operator and corner frequency. Pn propagation indicates very high Qp values in the lithosphere, of order 1000, while path-average Qp values in the upper mantle are on the order of 400. The variety of source epicentral distances and depths enables us to deduce the vertical Qp−1 structure of the upper mantle. Using the amplitude spectra directly in a weighted least squares problem that accounts for the effects of triplications in the traveltime curves, we invert for Qp−1 as a function of depth. We demonstrate that Qp is frequency dependent and adopt a power law dependence with coefficient $\alpha$ = 0.27. We resolve three distinct layers using a reference frequency of 1 Hz with Qp on the order of 145 at depths 100--250 km, Qp on the order of 350 at depths 250--410 km, and very high Qp with attenuation indistinguishable from zero for depths below 410 km. The P waves have a component of scattering, and thus, Qp−1 represents the maximum intrinsic attenuation beneath normal undisturbed oceanic lithosphere.},

We then measured phase-velocity anomalies of fundamental-mode and first higher-mode Rayleigh waves for each pair of stations at a period range of 5--25 s, and corrected the effect of variation in water-depths. The seismic anomalies imply the presence of strong azimuthal anisotropy beneath the eastern part of array.

	Abstract = {The complex ratio of vertical displacement to pressure (D/P) at seafloor is a function of frequency. It is sensitive to the subsurface elastic properties, particularly the shear modulus, and therefore can be used to determine the shear velocity and thickness of marine sediments. Instead of using compliance in response to loading of long-period infragravity waves as in previous studies, we investigate the transfer function from pressure to displacement using Rayleigh waves generated by microseisms and earthquakes. We find that at frequencies between 0.1 and 0.2 Hz, the Rayleigh wave transfer function is very sensitive to marine sediments and can be reliably obtained from microseism noise. Using a surface wave mode method, we calculate synthetic D/P ratios and examine their sensitivity to water depth, shear wave speed, and thickness of sediments. We develop a method to invert the Rayleigh wave D/P ratio for a regional 1-D profile of sediment shear wave speed and associated sediment thickness beneath each ocean bottom seismograph (OBS). We apply our method to a group of deep water OBSs deployed in the Cascadia Initiative and obtain a well-resolved depth-dependent shear wave speed for sediments on the Juan de Fuca plate and shear wave traveltime delays caused by sediments at each station.},

Using the multidisciplinary geophysical dataset of the MELT and GLIMPSE experiments, we show that associated with 3 volcanic chains west of the East Pacific Rise there are low seismic velocities and densities in the asthenosphere that extend to the East Pacific Rise spreading center. Analogous to the Hawaiian swell, the low-density anomalies produce swells beneath the volcanoes on young seafloor. The associated gravity anomalies are part of a set of gravity lineaments that have been previously interpreted as being due to thermo-elastic cracking of the lithosphere or small-scale convection. The correlation between the surface volcanism and subsurface density and velocity anomalies and their extension to the spreading center suggest that pre-existing, buoyant or fertile asthenospheric mantle heterogeneities are stretched in the direction of plate motion by shear between the plate and the underlying mantle. These heterogeneities seed small-scale convection, producing upwelling and pressure release melting, forming volcanic chains that extend nearly to the ridge axis.},

	Abstract = {Direct seismic measurements of the thickening of oceanic lithosphere away from the spreading axis are rare due to the remoteness of mid ocean ridges. On the East Pacific Rise, at 17$\,^{\circ}$S, there were two long-term broadband ocean bottom seismometer deployments, the MELT and GLIMPSE experiments. These arrays spanned young Pacific plate seafloor ranging in age from 0 to 8 Ma. Combining these two data sets, we describe the increase in Rayleigh wave phase velocities for 16--100 s period as function of distance from the ridge with two parameterizations: an arbitrary function of seafloor age and a simple polynomial function of age on the Pacific and Nazca plates. Although resolution analysis shows that 10 to 15 independent pieces of information about the age variation of phase velocity on the Pacific plate can be resolved at periods of ≤ 50 s, the three parameter polynomial model fits the data almost as well, indicating a simple pattern of the evolution of structure with age. To compare our observations to the predictions for the conductive cooling of the lithosphere, we convert a thermal half-space cooling model to shear velocity using anharmonic and anelastic contributions. The patterns in the velocities are not consistent with simple conductive cooling. The conductive cooling model under predicts the changes in phase velocity with age observed in the 20 to 78 s period range. We observe significant changes in shear velocity in the asthenosphere at depths greater than conductive cooling should extend. The asthenospheric low velocity zone is asymmetric, dipping to the west with the lowest velocities beneath the Pacific plate west of the spreading center. The conductive cooling model also over predicts the shear velocities in the lithosphere by {\~{}} 0.2 km/s. These anomalies indicate that more complicated mantle flow and significant mantle heterogeneities such as melt are required.},

	Abstract = {Low shear wave velocities beneath mid-ocean ridges and in the low-velocity zone beneath oceanic plates commonly have been attributed to the presence of melt or dissolved water, but several recent studies have challenged that interpretation. The alternative is that the anelastic effects of increasing temperature may cause the observed drop in velocity along with a predicted increase in attenuation. We report the first measurements of surface wave attenuation within regional arrays of seismometers on the seafloor. Near the East Pacific Rise, there is much less attenuation than is predicted by models in which the velocity is controlled solely by the direct elastic and anelastic effects of changing temperature, suggesting that melt and water concentration do play an important role. There also is somewhat less attenuation than is found in global studies; we speculate that scattering from unresolved velocity heterogeneities contribute to the apparent attenuation in global studies.},

	Abstract = {We test models for the origin of intraplate volcanic ridges and gravity lineations on young seafloor west of the East Pacific Rise using Rayleigh wave dispersion measured in the Gravity Lineations and Intraplate Melting Petrology and Seismic Expedition (GLIMPSE) seismic experiment. The excellent azimuthal distribution of teleseismic sources recorded over a 12-month period provides resolution of phase velocities at periods up to 100 s. The average phase velocities for the study area reveal a pronounced low-velocity zone reaching a minimum shear velocity of ∼3.95 km/s. The negative velocity gradient defining the base of the lithosphere, observed at 40 $\pm$ 15 km, abruptly reverses at 70 km depth. The underlying positive gradient changes slope at ∼125 km. We attribute these changes in gradient to the onset of incipient partial melting of upwelling mantle in the presence of water at 125 km, followed by increased melt production at 70 km that leads to dehydration of the residual matrix and migration of melt to the surface spreading center. Rayleigh wave tomography shows that there are anomalously low shear velocities extending to at least 50 km depth beneath the Sojourn Ridge and the Hotu Matua volcanic complex, with relatively high velocities between these volcanic chains. These observations are not consistent with passive models for the origin of the volcanic ridges involving lithospheric extension or thermoelastic cracking. Dynamic models invoking flow in the asthenosphere in the form of small-scale convection or viscous fingering instabilities may explain the observed pattern of seismic velocity anomalies.},

The structure of the ridge system is strongly asymmetric: mantle densities and seismic velocities are lower and seismic anisotropy is stronger to the west of the rise axis.},

	Abstract = {The Earth's transition zone has until recently been assumed to be seismically isotropic. Increasingly, however, evidence suggests that ordering of material over seismic wavelengths occurs there, but it is unclear what causes this. We use the method of source-side shear wave splitting to examine the anisotropy surrounding earthquakes deeper than 200 km in slabs around the globe. We find significant amounts of splitting (≤2.4 s), confirming that the transition zone is anisotropic here. However, there is no decrease in the amount of splitting with depth, as would be the case for a metastable tongue of olivine which thins with depth, suggesting this is not the cause. The amount of splitting does not appear to be consistent with processes in the ambient mantle, such as lattice-preferred orientation development in wadsleyite, ringwoodite, or MgSiO3-perovskite. We invert for the orientation of several mechanisms---subject to uncertainties in mineralogy and deformation---and the best fit is given by updip flattening in a style of anisotropy common to hydrous phases and layered inclusions. We suggest that highly anisotropic hydrous phases or hydrated layering is a likely cause of anisotropy within the slab, implying significant water transport from the surface down to at least 660 km depth.},

	Abstract = {Recent developments in the theory and calculation of wave propagation in anisotropic media have been published in the geophysical literature and refer specifically to seismological applications. Anisotropic phenomena are comparatively common, and it is the intention of this review to present these developments to a wider audience. Few of the results are new, but the opportunity is taken to tidy up a few loose ends, and present consistent theoretical formulations for the numerical solution of a number of propagation problems. Such numerical experiments have played a large part in our increasing understanding of wave motion in anisotropic media. It now appears that the solution of most problems in anisotropic propagation can be formulated, if the corresponding solution exists for isotropic propagation, and may be solved at the cost of considerably more numerical computation. There are two significant results from these developments: the recognition of the importance of body- and surface-wave polarizations in diagnosing and estimating anisotropy; and the recognition that many two-phase materials, particularly cracked solids, can be modelled by anisotropic elastic-constants. This last result opens up a new class of materials to wave-motion analysis, and has applications in a variety of different fields.},

Regional variation in shear-wave polarization is investigated from a teleseismic event and some local deep earthquakes using a spatially dense seismic array of the NIED located in the central part of Japan. A characteristic pattern is found on the spatial distribution of shear-wave polarization data obtained from ScS waves. Large and small values of shear-wave polarization anisotropy are observed at seismic stations located to the west and east of the volcanic front, respectively. The anisotropic zone with maximum velocity in N-S direction is localized in the wedge portion between the surface and subducting slab using the data of the local deep events. The location of the anisotropic zone corresponds with a low-Q zone obtained from seismic tomography data. We conclude that the azimuthal anisotropic zone in the mantle wedge is caused by melt-filled cracks, which is consistent with models obtained by petrological studies.},

	Abstract = {We have carried out a global investigation on seismic anisotropy in the lower mantle by comparing the waveform splitting of SKS and SKKS found at the same seismogram. The two shear waves have very similar ray paths in the upper mantle but different ones in the lower mantle. We collected a total of 104 SKS+SKKS waveform data recorded at 76 stations. The SKS+SKKS data are first matched with a single anisotropic model (2 parameters: the fast polarization direction ϕ and delay time $\delta$t) and two independent anisotropic models (4 parameters). We then applied an F-test to examine whether the 4-parameter models are better than the 2-parameter ones based on error improvement. We found that the data from most of the stations can be explained by the simple 2-parameter models. While this observation provides compelling evidence that the vast part of the lower mantle below ∼1000 km (including the D'' region) is transversely isotropic, it is still arguable that the uppermost lower mantle and the transition may partly contribute the SKS/SKKS splittings. We also found that the 4-parameter models provide a better fitting to the SKS and SKKS splitting at 8 stations, suggesting the existence of transverse anisotropy or anomalous dipping structures in some part of the lower mantle.},

@article{Kirby1996,
	Abstract = {Earth's deepest earthquakes occur as a population in subducting or previously subducted lithosphere at depths ranging from about 325 to 690 km. This depth interval closely brackets the mantle transition zone, characterized by rapid seismic velocity increases resulting from the transformation of upper mantle minerals to higher-pressure phases. Deep earthquakes thus provide the primary direct evidence for subduction of the lithosphere to these depths and allow us to investigate the deep thermal, thermodynamic, and mechanical ferment inside slabs. Numerical simulations of reaction rates show that the olivine → spinel transformation should be kinetically hindered in old, cold slabs descending into the transition zone. Thus wedge-shaped zones of metastable peridotite probably persist to depths of more than 600 km. Laboratory deformation experiments on some metastable minerals display a shear instability called transformational faulting. This instability involves sudden failure by localized superplasticity in thin shear zones where the metastable host mineral transforms to a denser, finer-grained phase. Hence in cold slabs, such faulting is expected for the polymorphic reactions in which olivine transforms to the spinel structure and clinoenstatite transforms to ilmenite. It is thus natural to hypothesize that deep earthquakes result from transformational faulting in metastable peridotite wedges within cold slabs. This consideration of the mineralogical states of slabs augments the traditional largely thermal view of slab processes and explains some previously enigmatic slab features. It explains why deep seismicity occurs only in the approximate depth range of the mantle transition zone, where minerals in downgoing slabs should transform to spinel and ilmenite structures. The onset of deep shocks at about 325 km is consistent with the onset of metastability near the equilibrium phase boundary in the slab. Even if a slab penetrates into the lower mantle, earthquakes should cease at depths near 700 km, because the seismogenic phase transformations in the slab are completed or can no longer occur. Substantial metastability is expected only in old, cold slabs, consistent with the observed restriction of deep earthquakes to those settings. Earthquakes should be restricted to the cold cores of slabs, as in any model in which the seismicity is temperature controlled, via the distribution of metastability. However, the geometries of recent large deep earthquakes pose a challenge for any such models. Transformational faulting may give insight into why deep shocks lack appreciable aftershocks and why their source characteristics, including focal mechanisms indicating localized shear failure rather than implosive deformation, are so similar to those of shallow earthquakes. Finally, metastable phase changes in slabs would produce an internal source of stress in addition to those due to the weight of the sinking slab. Such internal stresses may explain the occurrence of earthquakes in portions of lithosphere which have foundered to the bottom of the transition zone and/or are detached from subducting slabs. Metastability in downgoing slabs could have considerable geodynamic significance. Metastable wedges would reduce the negative buoyancy of slabs, decrease the driving force for subduction, and influence the state of stress in slabs. Heat released by metastable phase changes would raise temperatures within slabs and facilitate the transformation of spinel to the lower mantle mineral assemblage, causing slabs to equilibrate more rapidly with the ambient mantle and thus contribute to the cessation of deep seismicity. Because wedge formation should occur only for fast subducting slabs, it may act as a ``parachute'' and contribute to regulating plate speeds. Wedge formation would also have consequences for mantle evolution because the density of a slab stagnated near the bottom of the transition zone would increase as it heats up and the wedge transforms to denser spinel, favoring the subsequent sinking of the slab into the lower mantle.},

@article{Holtzman2010,
	Abstract = {Based on observations in both the laboratory and the Earth, we develop the hypothesis that plate boundaries are lubricated by networks of melt-rich shear zones. Such lubrication would serve to reduce effective strength and focus deformation at plates boundaries. This idea emerges from two sets of observations: (1) stress-driven melt segregation and organization in experimentally deformed mantle rocks and (2) seismic anisotropy patterns as observed at three divergent plate boundaries (the Ethiopian Rift, the Reykjanes Ridge, and the East Pacific Rise). In all three tectonic settings, the magnitude of anisotropy is greatest at the probable locations of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary within the plate boundary (``marginal LAB''). Seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is controlled by the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of predominant olivine and the alignment of melt structures. The observed patterns of anisotropy are controlled by the dip angle of the marginal LAB. When steeply dipping, shear wave splitting in vertically traveling waves (e.g., SKS phases) is most sensitive to the alignment of melt, and surface waves should reveal faster Rayleigh wave velocities than Love wave velocities (VSV {\textgreater} VSH). When shallowly dipping, shear wave splitting in vertically traveling body waves is controlled by olivine LPO, and surface waves show faster Love wave velocities than Rayleigh wave velocities (VSV {\textless} VSH). The formation of melt-rich networks by stress-driven segregation should be most effective where strain rates are highest. These melt-lubricated shear zones will reduce effective viscosity relative to the direct extrapolation of viscosity values derived from laboratory creep experiments on homogenous samples. A composite model of anisotropic seismic properties is developed to test the hypothesis that melt segregates along the LAB, incorporating olivine fabrics with oriented and segregated melt over a range of length scales. This model is applied to observations from the three example plate boundaries, leaving the reader to speculate on the implications for interpretation of anisotropy patterns at other geodynamic settings.},

@article{Morgan1987,
	Abstract = {Mid-ocean ridge volcanism is largely concentrated within a few kilometers of the spreading axis. Geophysical models of upwelling induced melting beneath a ridge axis predict significant melting within a ∼100 kilometer wide region beneath a ridge axis. This provides a strong constraint for testing models of melt migration beneath a spreading center since a successful melt migration mechanism must be able to focus melt from a broad region of melt production to the narrow emplacement zone at the ridge axis. Tensile dike propagation transport of melt within the mantle would move melt away from the ridge axis and thus does not satisfy this constraint. However, porous flow of melt within a viscously deforming asthenosphere is a viable possibility. Models of porous flow are constructed which consider the effects of mantle flow-induced pressure gradients and strain-induced anisotropic permeability on porous melt migration. In order for flow-induced pressure gradients to shape melt migration the sub-ridge asthenospheric viscosity must be 1021 Pa-s, two orders of magnitude larger than currently accepted values. Mantle strain-induced anisotropic permeability variations can explain the focussing of melt towards the ridge axis if the ratio of the directional anisotropic permeabilities is as small as 3. Furthermore, mantle strain-induced anisotropy in rock permeability may be an important mechanism shaping melt migration within the mantle.},

	Abstract = {The easternmost segment of the Nankai trough remained unruptured during the 1944 and 1946 earthquakes that affected the rest of the trench. It is therefore a zone of seismic gap that also undergoes a peculiar tectonic regime due to its proximity with the Izu collision zone. We investigate this area with densely sampled active seismic data. One hundred ocean bottom seismometers, spaced only 1 km apart, were deployed along a line perpendicular to the trough. A two-step tomographic approach, designed for this type of acquisition, is applied: first, a long-wavelength velocity model is built by a linearized inversion of first arrival travel times, its resolution is assessed, and its reliability is confirmed through a semiglobal approach in which a large range of starting models is tested; second, this tomographic model is used to exploit late reflected arrivals with a prestack depth migration, the result of which is validated by classically modeling refraction and reflection travel times in the derived structural model. Thus both velocities and discontinuities are mapped in our model with a minimum of data interpretation and a priori knowledge. Our results bring new insights on the deep crustal zones of the margin and its evolution. The existence of presently inactivated major thrusts is very clearly evidenced in the backstop. A general timing for its evolution and deformation is proposed. Farther seaward, the presence of a subducted ridge beneath the accretionary wedge is confirmed. Its compressive structure and origin are demonstrated. It exhibits a thickened lower crust which nature is discussed. Besides, strong analogies between this ``Paleo-Zenisu'' subducting ridge and the Zenisu ridge, observed farther south, are also emphasized, bringing evidences for a steady state crustal deformation pattern.},

	Abstract = {In offshore surveys, the deep crust is generally investigated by traveltime tomography applied to sparse ocean bottom seismometer data. The inferred velocity models are of limited resolution precluding a quantitative analysis of deep tectonic discontinuities. If dense arrays of ocean bottom seismometers can be deployed, the resulting data sets become amenable to full waveform processing, which should lead to a significant improvement in the resolution of structures. Such acquisition and processing were achieved on the eastern Nankai subduction zone. Full waveform inversion is entirely implemented in the frequency domain, enabling efficient finite difference wave modeling and allowing to limit the inversion to a few discrete frequencies of increasing value. Such a hierarchical procedure defines a multiresolution approach to seismic imaging. The data set was recorded by 93 instruments deployed along a 105-km-long profile. Thirteen frequencies ranging from 3 to 15 Hz were inverted sequentially. Wavelengths imaged by the full waveform inversion typically range between 0.5 and 8 km. Full waveform tomography reveals an intense compression in the upper prism and underlying backstop, as evidenced by several thrusts, the frontal ones still active, corresponding to negative velocity anomalies. The subducting Paleo-Zenisu ridge is also reconstructed, above which stands the d{\'{e}}collement. Velocities in the upper mantle beneath the ridge are rather low (7.5 km s−1), suggesting partially serpentinized mantle beneath the ridge. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of full waveform tomography based on dense ocean bottom seismometer data sets and its ability to quantitatively image the entire crust with a significantly improved resolution compared to what is usually achieved through traveltime tomography.},

	Abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful tool used to quantify the elastic properties of the subsurface from seismic data. Because of very high computational cost, the technique has so far been used for either 2-D full elastic or 3-D acoustic media while the extension to 3-D elastic media to a realistic model size is still a challenging task. However, the Earth being 3-D, elastic and highly heterogeneous, one would require a full 3-D elastic wave equation for accurate modelling of amplitudes and phases within the inversion process. The acoustic approximation could significantly impact the final waveform inversion results, mainly due to the amplitude variation with offset effect. This effect becomes extremely important in the presence of strong contrasts in S-wave velocity and density, specifically when long-offset reflection data are included for waveform inversion. Recent increase in computer power allows for more efficient parallel computing using thousands of processors simultaneously thus making 3-D elastic waveform inversion feasible today. In this paper we consider a synthetic study based on a 3-D elastic medium for inversion of both P- and S-wave velocities using multicomponent, ocean-bottom cable seismic data. Both the forward modelling part and the inversion part are carried out in the time domain. The inverse problem is parametrized in terms of P- and S-wave velocities, while the density, being difficult to reconstruct, is not inverted and is linked to the P-wave velocity. Among several synthetic examples, a successful experiment on a small part of a 3-D SEG/EAGE overthrust model is presented, demonstrating the feasibility of inverting and accurately quantifying both P- and S-wave velocities. The resolution analysis of the waveform inversion is tested using a checkerboard model. Our results show that 3-D elastic FWI of sparsely spaced sources can retrieve P- and S-wave velocities accurately.},

	Abstract = {We apply Frequency-domain Waveform Tomography to form quantitative, high-resolution P-wave velocity images of a megasplay fault system within the central Nankai subduction zone offshore of southwest Japan, using controlled source Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) data originally acquired in 2004. The Waveform Tomography method exploits recorded seismic waveforms beyond their first arrivals, and thus achieves a much higher resolution (of the order of a wavelength) than that of conventional Traveltime Tomography methods. Frequency-domain Waveform Tomography facilitates a multi-scale approach to stabilize the inversion, in which initial Traveltime Tomography results are sequentially improved on by first fitting low frequency components of the seismic records (starting at 2.25 Hz); higher frequency components (up to 8.5 Hz) are then introduced progressively. Our final Waveform Tomography image allows velocity anomalies as small as 700 m (horizontally) and 350 m (vertically) to be discerned and interpreted, as confirmed by checkerboard modeling tests. The improved explanatory power of the final images is verified by observing that synthetic waveforms calculated from the final results yield much better fit to the observed waveforms than those estimated from the original Traveltime Tomography image. Apparent lithological boundaries from Waveform Tomography agree well with corresponding reflections on seismic migration images, providing further confidence in the validity of the results. The megasplay fault is evident on the final Waveform Tomography image as a sharp velocity discontinuity, delineating the upper surface of a velocity reduction of nearly 1 km/s with respect to the regional 1D velocity trend. The megasplay fault can be traced continuously throughout the entire image, from a nearly horizontal section at the landward extent, moving seaward through to a steeper angle penetrating the old accretionary prisms, with several additional splays appearing to branch in the shallow subsurface. The location of the low-velocity zones imaged by our waveform tomography method coincides with two-previously-identified low velocity zones. The image reveals a low velocity zone that is continuous from deeper to shallower portions of the subsurface, suggesting that pore-fluids may be transported from the inner wedge, to the transition zone, and to the surface, through fluid conduits associated with the megasplay fault system.},

	Abstract = {We combine spectral-element simulations and adjoint techniques in a non-linear full seismic waveform tomography for the radially anisotropic structure of the Australasian upper mantle. Our method allows us to explain 30 s waveforms in detail, and it yields tomographic images with locally 2∘ lateral resolution. In the course of 19 conjugate-gradient iterations the total number of exploitable waveforms increased from 2200 to nearly 3000. The final model, AMSAN.19, thus explains data that were not initially included in the inversion. This is strong evidence for the effectiveness of the inversion scheme and the physical consistency of the tomographic model. AMSAN.19 confirms long-wavelength heterogeneities found in previous studies, and it allows us to draw the following inferences concerning the past and present states of the Australian upper mantle and the formation of seismic anisotropy: (1) Small-scale neutral to low-velocity patches beneath central Australia are likely to be related to localised Paleozoic intraplate deformation. (2) Increasing seismic velocities between the Moho and 150 km depth are found beneath parts of Proterozoic Australia, suggesting thermochemical variations related to the formation and fragmentation of a Centralian Superbasin. (3) Radial anisotropy above 150 km depth reveals a clear ocean--continent dichotomy: We find strong vsh {\textgreater} vsv beneath the Coral and Tasman Seas. The anisotropy is strongest at the top of the inferred asthenospheric flow channel, where strain is expected to be largest. Radial anisotropy beneath the continent is weaker but more variable. Localised patches with vsh {\textless} vsv appear, in accord with small-scale intraplate deformation. (4) The ocean--continent dichotomy disappears gradually between 150 and 250 km depth, where the continental lithospheric mantle and the oceanic asthenosphere pass into the underlying convecting mantle. (5) Significant anisotropy exists below 250 km depth. Its character can be explained by sublithospheric small-scale convection and a change in the dominant glide system of olivine.},

	Abstract = {Modeling of seismic-wave propagation in anisotropic medium with irregular topography is beneficial to interpret seismic data acquired by active and passive source seismology conducted in areas of interest such as mountain ranges and basins. The major challenge in this context is the difficulty in tackling the irregular free-surface boundary condition in a Cartesian coordinate system. To implement surface topography, we use the boundary-conforming grid and map a rectangular grid onto a curved grid. We use a stable and explicit second-order accurate finite-difference scheme to discretize the elastic wave equations (in a curvilinear coordinate system) in a 3D heterogeneous transversely isotropic medium. The free-surface boundary conditions are accurately applied by introducing a discretization that uses boundary-modified difference operators for the mixed derivatives in the governing equations. The accuracy of the proposed method is checked by comparing the numerical results obtained by the trial algorithm with the analytical solutions of the Lamb's problem, for an isotropic medium and a transversely isotropic medium with a vertical symmetry axis, respectively. Efficiency tests performed by different numerical experiments illustrate clearly the influence of an irregular (nonflat) free surface on seismic-wave propagation.},

	Abstract = {We present a full seismic waveform tomography for upper-mantle structure in the Australasian region. Our method is based on spectral-element simulations of seismic wave propagation in 3-D heterogeneous earth models. The accurate solution of the forward problem ensures that waveform misfits are solely due to as yet undiscovered Earth structure and imprecise source descriptions, thus leading to more realistic tomographic images and source parameter estimates. To reduce the computational costs, we implement a long-wavelength equivalent crustal model.We quantify differences between the observed and the synthetic waveforms using time---frequency (TF) misfits. Their principal advantages are the separation of phase and amplitude misfits, the exploitation of complete waveform information and a quasi-linear relation to 3-D Earth structure. Fr{\'{e}}chet kernels for the TF misfits are computed via the adjoint method. We propose a simple data compression scheme and an accuracy-adaptive time integration of the wavefields that allows us to reduce the storage requirements of the adjoint method by almost two orders of magnitude.To minimize the waveform phase misfit, we implement a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. Amplitude information is incorporated indirectly by a restricted line search. This ensures that the cumulative envelope misfit does not increase during the inversion. An efficient pre-conditioner is found empirically through numerical experiments. It prevents the concentration of structural heterogeneity near the sources and receivers.We apply our waveform tomographic method to ≈1000 high-quality vertical-component seismograms, recorded in the Australasian region between 1993 and 2008. The waveforms comprise fundamental- and higher-mode surface and long-period S body waves in the period range from 50 to 200 s. To improve the convergence of the algorithm, we implement a 3-D initial model that contains the long-wavelength features of the Australasian region. Resolution tests indicate that our algorithm converges after around 10 iterations and that both long- and short-wavelength features in the uppermost mantle are well resolved. There is evidence for effects related to the non-linearity in the inversion procedure.After 11 iterations we fit the data waveforms acceptably well; with no significant further improvements to be expected. During the inversion the total fitted seismogram length increases by 46 per cent, providing a clear indication of the efficiency and consistency of the iterative optimization algorithm. The resulting SV-wave velocity model reveals structural features of the Australasian upper mantle with great detail. We confirm the existence of a pronounced low-velocity band along the eastern margin of the continent that can be clearly distinguished against Precambrian Australia and the microcontinental Lord Howe Rise. The transition from Precambrian to Phanerozoic Australia (the Tasman Line) appears to be sharp down to at least 200 km depth. It mostly occurs further east of where it is inferred from gravity and magnetic anomalies. Also clearly visible are the Archean and Proterozoic cratons, the northward continuation of the continent and anomalously low S-wave velocities in the upper mantle in central Australia.This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of non-linear full seismic waveform tomography to a continental-scale problem.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new approach to full seismic waveform inversion on continental and global scales. This is based on the time--frequency transform of both data and synthetic seismograms with the use of time- and frequency-dependent phase and envelope misfits. These misfits allow us to provide a complete quantification of the differences between data and synthetics while separating phase and amplitude information. The result is an efficient exploitation of waveform information that is robust and quasi-linearly related to Earth's structure. Thus, the phase and envelope misfits are usable for continental- and global-scale tomography, that is, in a scenario where the seismic wavefield is spatially undersampled and where a 3-D reference model is usually unavailable. Body waves, surface waves and interfering phases are naturally included in the analysis. We discuss and illustrate technical details of phase measurements such as the treatment of phase jumps and instability in the case of small amplitudes.The Fr{\'{e}}chet kernels for phase and envelope misfits can be expressed in terms of their corresponding adjoint wavefields and the forward wavefield. The adjoint wavefields are uniquely determined by their respective adjoint-source time functions. We derive the adjoint-source time functions for phase and envelope misfits. The adjoint sources can be expressed as inverse time--frequency transforms of a weighted phase difference or a weighted envelope difference.In a comparative study, we establish connections between the phase and envelope misfits and the following widely used measures of seismic waveform differences: (1) cross-correlation time-shifts; (2) relative rms amplitude differences; (3) generalized seismological data functionals and (4) the L2 distance between data and synthetics used in time-domain full-waveform inversion.We illustrate the computation of Fr{\'{e}}chet kernels for phase and envelope misfits with data from an event in the West Irian region of Indonesia, recorded on the Australian continent. The synthetic seismograms are computed for a heterogeneous 3-D velocity model of the Australian upper mantle, with a spectral-element method. The examples include P body waves, Rayleigh waves and S waves, interfering with higher-mode surface waves. All the kernels differ from the more familar kernels for cross-correlation time-shifts or relative rms amplitude differences. The differences arise from interference effects, 3-D Earth's structure and waveform dissimilarities that are due to waveform dispersion in the heterogeneous Earth.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the SH-wave velocity and attenuation structures of the western US upper mantle using the dense network of the USArray and new techniques: we observe a multiple-frequency data set of both traveltime and amplitude anomalies, and interpret these with full 3-D finite-frequency sensitivity kernels. Amplitudes show stronger frequency dependence than traveltimes. We perform a joint inversion on the measured traveltime and amplitude anomalies, interpreting them in terms of velocity and attenuation heterogeneities. Aside from the expected clear division between the slow, tectonically active region in the west and the fast craton in the east, several interesting smaller velocity anomalies are observed. The subduction along the Cascades at 1002013300 km depths shows lateral discontinuity, with a 'slab hole' (absence of fast anomalies) observed around 45{\^{A}}$\,^{\circ}$N. The delaminated Sierra Nevada Mountains root is observed to have sunk to 200 km depth. The Yellowstone plume seems to have an origin (weak slow velocity anomalies) near 1000 km depth, but the plume conduit seems to be interrupted by a fast anomaly, which is identified as a fragment of the Farallon slab. The S-velocity model shows a trench-perpendicular 'slab gap' (absence of fast anomalies) at almost the same location as in the P model recently published by Sigloch et al. (2008). The methodological improvements described in the first paragraph have several benefits. Amplitude data help to sharpen the edges of narrow velocity heterogeneities in the shallow upper mantle. The focusing effect from velocity heterogeneity dominates over that of attenuation and must be considered when interpreting amplitude anomalies. In general, velocity and attenuation heterogeneities correlate positively, suggesting that temperature plays a major role in forming the anomalies.},

@article{Fichtner2013,
	Abstract = {We develop and apply a full waveform inversion method that incorporates seismic data on a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, thereby constraining the details of both crustal and upper-mantle structure. This is intended to further our understanding of crust--mantle interactions that shape the nature of plate tectonics, and to be a step towards improved tomographic models of strongly scale-dependent earth properties, such as attenuation and anisotropy.The inversion for detailed regional earth structure consistently embedded within a large-scale model requires locally refined numerical meshes that allow us to (1) model regional wave propagation at high frequencies, and (2) capture the inferred fine-scale heterogeneities. The smallest local grid spacing sets the upper bound of the largest possible time step used to iteratively advance the seismic wave field. This limitation leads to extreme computational costs in the presence of fine-scale structure, and it inhibits the construction of full waveform tomographic models that describe earth structure on multiple scales. To reduce computational requirements to a feasible level, we design a multigrid approach based on the decomposition of a multiscale earth model with widely varying grid spacings into a family of single-scale models where the grid spacing is approximately uniform. Each of the single-scale models contains a tractable number of grid points, which ensures computational efficiency. The multi-to-single-scale decomposition is the foundation of iterative, gradient-based optimization schemes that simultaneously and consistently invert data on all scales for one multi-scale model.We demonstrate the applicability of our method in a full waveform inversion for Eurasia, with a special focus on Anatolia where coverage is particularly dense. Continental-scale structure is constrained by complete seismic waveforms in the 30--200 s period range. In addition to the well-known structural elements of the Eurasian mantle, our model reveals a variety of subtle features, such as the Armorican Massif, the Rhine Graben and the Massif Central. Anatolia is covered by waveforms with 8--200 s period, meaning that the details of both crustal and mantle structure are resolved consistently. The final model contains numerous previously undiscovered structures, including the extension-related updoming of lower-crustal material beneath the Menderes Massif in western Anatolia.Furthermore, the final model for the Anatolian region confirms estimates of crustal depth from receiver function analysis, and it accurately explains cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise at 10 s period that have not been used in the tomographic inversion. This provides strong independent evidence that detailed 3-D structure is well resolved.},

@article{Morozov2008,
	Abstract = {SUMMARY A geometrical attenuation model is proposed as an alternative to the conventional frequency-dependent attenuation law Q(f) =Q0(f/f0)$\eta$. The new model provides a straightforward differentiation between the geometrical and effective attenuation (Qe) which incorporates the intrinsic attenuation and small-scale scattering. Unlike the (Q0, $\eta$) description, the inversion procedure uses only the spectral amplitude data and does not rely on elaborate theoretical models or restrictive assumptions. Data from over 40 reported studies were transformed to the new parametrization. The levels of geometrical attenuation strongly correlate with crustal tectonic types and decrease with tectonic age. The corrected values of Qe are frequency-independent and generally significantly higher than Q0 and show no significant correlation with tectonic age. Several case studies were revisited in detail, with significant changes in the interpretations. The absorption-band and the `10-Hz transition' are not found in the corrected Qe data, and therefore, these phenomena are interpreted as related to geometrical attenuation. The absorption band could correspond to changes in the dominant mode content of the wavefield as the frequency changes from about 0.1 to 100 Hz. Alternatively, it could also be a pure artefact related to the power-law Q(f) paradigm above. The explicit separation of the geometrical and intrinsic attenuation achieves three goals: (1) it provides an unambiguous, assumption- and model-free description of attenuation, (2) it allows relating the observations to the basic physics and geology and (3) it simplifies the interpretation because of reduced emphasis on the apparent Q(f) dependence. The model also agrees remarkably well with the initial attempts for finite-difference short-period coda waveform modelling. Because of its consistency and direct link to the observations, the approach should also help in building robust and transportable coda magnitudes and in seismic regionalization.},

	Abstract = {Waveform tomography is conducted for SH velocity structures of the entire mantle using approximately 3.5 times the data used for obtaining the previous model, SH18CE. The resultant new model, SH18CEX, exhibits a cluster of ridge-like low-velocity anomalies in the western part of the Pacific Large Low-Shear-Velocity Province (LLSVP). The location of the ridge-like anomalies is in good agreement with the location of the abrupt change in the topography of the D??? discontinuity. These results suggest that the LLSVP is associated with a cluster of ridge-like-piles, rather than a single large pile spread over the entire region. The piles probably consist of intrinsically dense material; however, either their volume or density contrast may not be sufficiently large to develop large-scale domes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Schweitzer2002,
	Abstract = {At epicentral distances less than 30$\,^{\circ}$, the steep-angle reflections PcP and ScP from the core--mantle boundary (CMB) are normally difficult to identify and rarely reported. The reason is that the reflection coefficient at the CMB for these phases is relatively small and PcP and ScP onsets are often disturbed by interference with other more prominent phases. However, the absolute traveltimes of PcP and ScP in the steep-angle range are the most sensitive seismic phases for depth undulations of the CMB and, in addition, of all CMB reflections, these phases are influenced least by lateral heterogeneities along their ray paths. During this study, a set of more than 200 such reflections from the Earth's core, observed at European stations with reflection points below Europe, was collected and analysed. Starting from observations at the GERES array in Germany, PcP and ScP could also be identified at other European seismic stations. The stations used for this study were the Fennoscandian arrays NORSAR, NORES, and FINES, the Gr{\"{a}}fenberg array in Germany, and the stations of the German Regional Seismic Network (GRSN). With the combined investigation of PcP and ScP, a map of reflection points of the CMB below Europe could be constructed. To reduce the influence of location and other errors, traveltime differences were measured between the onsets of P (or Pn), PcP and ScP. These traveltime differences show positive and negative deviations from theoretical values of up to several seconds. CMB undulations of up to $\pm$6 km as discussed in the literature change the absolute traveltimes of PcP (or ScP) only by about 0.9 (or 1.2) s for an epicentral distance of 20$\,^{\circ}$. The observed residuals can be explained by several factors still unresolved location errors, lateral heterogeneities along the whole ray paths of all investigated phases, or undulations of the depth of the CMB. All observed traveltime effects must be known at least one order of magnitude better than the expected effects to resolve statistically reliable CMB undulations. Inverting the residuals for possible CMB undulations shows that if there is any CMB signal in the data, it is very small. Most of the observed residuals can easily be explained by smaller changes in event depth, lateral heterogeneities in the source region and along the whole ray paths, and/or station corrections but the observations do not require any CMB topography. If such undulations of up to $\pm$6 km exist, all other traveltime effects will mask them. Coming to this disillusioning result by using the most sensitive data to resolve a CMB topography can only lead to this conclusion; all models of CMB undulations derived from traveltime data must be taken as very unsure and any far reaching interpretations of such models should be avoided.},

Short-period precursors suggest the presence of smaller scale anomalies accompanying these larger Gaussian-shaped structures.
