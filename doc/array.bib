abstract = {Seismic coda waves have complex waveforms and are considered to be caused by 3-dimensional structural heterogeneities. We carried out 3-component small-aperture array observations of seismic coda waves from natural earthquakes in Tsukuba, central Japan, to decompose complex coda waveforms and to clarify the nature of crustal heterogeneity. Epicentral distances in the present study are less than 200 km. The observational results are summarized as follows: 1) The remarkable feature of the coda from natural earthquakes is the difference between the P-coda and the S-coda especially in the vertical component. The P-coda consists mainly of coherent P-wave phases which have almost the same slowness vector as the initial P-wave motion, whereas the S-coda is decomposed into incoherent phases with random propagation directions. 2) Coherency of waveforms among the array sensors of the vertical component rapidly becomes low from the high value of coherency of the direct S-wave. 3) In the two horizontal components, radial and transverse ones, both the P- and S-coda are decomposed into incoherent random phases. 4) Coherency in the early S-coda of the horizontal components gradually becomes low compared to the vertical component. These features indicate that S to P converted waves at horizontal boundaries of the structure are dominant in the P-coda of the vertical component, while the P-coda of the horizontal components and the S-coda consist of scattered waves from the lateral heterogeneity. This interpretation leads to a model of crustal heterogeneity in which the degree of the lateral heterogeneity is smaller than the degree of vertical heterogeneity of layered structures.},

abstract = {The retrieval of near-receiver mantle structure from scattered waves associated with teleseismic P and S and recorded on three-component, linear seismic arrays is considered in the context of inverse scattering theory. A Ray + Born formulation is proposed which admits linearization of the forward problem and economy in the computation of the elastic wave Green's function. The high-frequency approximation further simplifies the problem by enabling (1) the use of an earth-flattened, 1-D reference model, (2) a reduction in computations to 2-D through the assumption of 2.5-D experimental geometry, and (3) band-diagonalization of the Hessian matrix in the inverse formulation. The final expressions are in a form reminiscent of the classical diffraction stack of seismic migration. Implementation of this procedure demands an accurate estimate of the scattered wave contribution to the impulse response, and thus requires the removal of both the reference wavefield and the source time signature from the raw record sections. An approximate separation of direct and scattered waves is achieved through application of the inverse free-surface transfer operator to individual station records and a Karhunen-Loeve transform to the resulting record sections. This procedure takes the full displacement field to a wave vector space wherein the first principal component of the incident wave-type section is identified with the direct wave and is used as an estimate of the source time function. The scattered displacement field is reconstituted from the remaining principal components using the forward free-surface transfer operator, and may be reduced to a scattering impulse response upon deconvolution of the source estimate. An example employing pseudo-spectral synthetic seismograms demonstrates an application of the methodology.},

abstract = {Lower mantle structure beneath central Eurasia is examined using a recently developed technique for migrating parametric representations of shear waves from teleseismic events. The migration method of Lay and Young [Lay, T., Young, C.J., 1996. Imaging scattering structures in the lower mantle by migration of long period shear waves. J. Geophys. Res., 101: 20 023–20 040.] assumes isotropic scattering from discrete heterogeneities to account for S wave coda arrivals, and provides resolution at scale lengths of about 500 km. The migration is applied to 15 s period shear wave data from 21 western Pacific earthquakes recorded in Europe and the Middle East that exhibit extra arrivals between S and ScS on the transverse components. Migrations are performed using PREM as well as model SGLE [Gaherty, J.B., Lay, T., 1992. Investigation of laterally heterogeneous shear velocity structure in D″ beneath Eurasia. J. Geophys. Res., 97: 417–435.], which has a discontinuity at 2605 km, 286 km above the core–mantle boundary. The migration images for the most coherent coda arrival (Scd) resemble those expected for a lower mantle discontinuity model and simulations are performed for models with discontinuities at various depths. Quantitative correlation of the images for the data and synthetic migrations show the optimal average depth of the discontinuity to be 2605 km. Migrations of subsets of the data suggest that the discontinuity depth varies from 2605 km in the northern end of the study area to 2620 km in the southern end. An additional intermediate arrival (Scd2) is observed in a limited portion of the dataset, and migrations indicate this phase is generated by localized discrete scatterers located at depths of 2750 to 2770 km under north–central Eurasia. These results are generally consistent with previous forward modeling studies, but the migration approach allows lateral variations to be modeled more systematically. The heterogeneous structure near the base of the mantle appears to be a manifestation of a complex boundary layer.},

abstract = {The concept of semblance is introduced, along with a descriptive review of several of the more common likeness or coherence measures. Measures are considered from three points of view: the domain in which they are applied, the philosophy of their design, and the manner in which they are used.Crosscorrelation, the most familiar of the likeness criteria, is examined in detail. Differences of design philosophy are noted as expressing themselves by a change in the normalization. Semblance is shown to be related to an energy-normalized crosscorrelation and to share certain features of the summation method or stack which has been used recently as a coherence measure.Several coherence measures, including semblance, are considered in a problem environment--the determination of stacking velocities from multiple ground coverage seismic data. A noise-free synthetic example is studied in order to compare discrimination thresholds of the various methods. Semblance, when properly interpreted, proves to have the greatest power of discrimination among the candidates examined for the particular application.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of precursors to PP produced by underside reflections from discontinuities in the upper mantle beneath the NW Pacific. The events used for this study occur in the western Pacific Rim (New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon, New Guinea, Philippine Islands) and are recorded at the short-period Yellowknife Array (YKA) in northern Canada. The source–receiver combination results in PP reflection points which allow us to study the upper mantle structure in a corridor from the Hawaiian Islands to the Kuril subduction zone. To detect the weak precursors in the time window between the P arrival and the PP onset and to identify them as PP underside reflections, special array techniques are used. Our analysis indicates a reflector at a depth of ∼200 km beneath the northwestern Pacific. This reflector shows strong topography of some tens of kilometres on length scales of several hundred kilometres, complicating the detection of this reflector in global or regional stacks of seismograms. Different models for the impedance jump across the reflector, the thickness and the possible fine structure of the reflector are modelled using synthetic seismograms and are compared with the data. The thickness of the reflector has to be less than 7 km and the P wave impedance contrast has to be larger than 5.0–6.5 per cent to be detected by this study. This corresponds to a P-velocity jump of ∼4 per cent assuming the PREM density model.},
