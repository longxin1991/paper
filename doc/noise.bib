abstract = {Theoretical studies on ambient seismic noise (ASN) predict that complete Green's function between seismic stations can be retrieved from cross correlation. However, only fundamental mode surface waves emerge in most studies involving real data. Here we show that Moho-reflected body wave (SmS) and its multiples can be identified with ASN for station pairs near their critical distances in the short period band (1-5 s). We also show that an uneven distribution of noise sources, such as mining activity and wind-topography interaction, can cause surface wave precursors, which mask weaker body wave phases.},

abstract = {Recently a few groups reported existence of Earth's background free oscillations even on seismically quiet days. Observed features suggest that they are persistently excited on or just above the Earth's surface owing most likely to atmospheric and/or oceanic disturbances. To constrain their excitation mechanisms we developed a new method for estimation of spatial distribution of their excitation sources by modeling cross spectra between pairs of stations. The method is to calculate synthetic cross spectra for spatially homogeneous distribution of random sources and invert with them the observed cross spectra to the heterogeneous source distribution. We applied this method to the IRIS records at 54 stations during 1988–2000. The result showed clear temporal variations of spatial patterns. From November to April the spatial distribution shows a degree 1 pattern with the maximum in the North Pacific Ocean. From May to October strong excitation sources are located along the eastern and western Pacific rims through the Indian Ocean. In all the time periods, excitation sources on continents are weaker than in oceanic areas. This temporal variation of the spatial pattern is qualitatively consistent with that reported by Rhie and Romanowicz (2004). However, the excitation sources are not localized in shallow seas, as might be expected from the hypothesis of excitation by ocean infragravity waves, but must be distributed on the whole sea surface.},

abstract = {In the 1990s, the method of time-reversed acoustics was developed. This method exploits the fact that the acoustic wave equation for a lossless medium is invariant for time reversal. When ultrasonic responses recorded by piezoelectric transducers are reversed in time and fed simultaneously as source signals to the transducers, they focus at the position of the original source, even when the medium is very complex. In seismic interferometry the time-reversed responses are not physically sent into the earth, but they are convolved with other measured responses. The effect is essentially the same: The time-reversed signals focus and create a virtual source which radiates waves into the medium that are subsequently recorded by receivers. A mathematical derivation, based on reciprocity theory, formalizes this principle: The cross- correlation of responses at two receivers, integrated over different sources, gives the Green’s function emitted by a virtual source at the position of one of the receivers and observed by the other receiver. This Green’s function representation for seismic interferometry is based on the assumption that the medium is lossless and nonmoving. Recent developments, circumventing these assumptions, include interferometric representations for attenuating and/or moving media, as well as unified representations for waves and diffusion phenomena, bending waves, quantum mechanical scattering, potential fields, elastodynamic, electromagnetic, poroelastic, and electroseismic waves. Significant improvements in the quality of the retrieved Green’s functions have been obtained with interferometry by deconvolution. A trace-by-trace deconvolution process compensates for complex source functions and the attenuation of the medium. Interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution also compensates for the effects of one-sided and/or irregular illumination.},

abstract = {Ambient noise correlation is now widely used in seismology to obtain the surface waves part of Green's function. More difficult is the extraction of body waves from noise correlations. Using 42 temporary broad-band three components stations located on the northern part of the fennoscandian region, we identify high-frequency (0.5–2 Hz) body waves emerging from noise correlations for inter-station distances up to 550 km. The comparison of the noise correlations with earthquake data confirms that the observed waves can be interpreted as P and S waves reflected from the Moho. Because the crustal model of the area is well known, we also compared the noise correlations with synthetic seismograms, and found an excellent agreement between the travel times of all the observed phases. Polarization analysis provides a further argument to confirm the observation of body waves.},

abstract = {Interstation cross correlations of ambient seismic noise from 1 year of continuous data at periods between 6 and 50 s are used to study the origin of the ambient noise using stations located in Europe, southern Africa, Asia, and three regions within North America. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of Rayleigh waves for positive and negative correlation time lags at periods of 8, 14, 25 and 50 s are used to determine the azimuthal distribution of strong ambient noise sources. Ambient noise in both the primary (10–20 s) and secondary microseism bands (5–10 s) comes dominantly from the directions of relatively nearby coastlines with stronger noise occurring in the Northern Hemisphere in northern winter and in the Southern Hemisphere in southern winter, consistent with the hypothesis that oceanic microseisms are generating this noise. The observed differences in the directivity of noise in the primary and secondary microseism bands are the consequence of propagation and attenuation, rather than the location of generation. At intermediate and long periods (>20 s), there is much less seasonal variation in both signal strength and directivity. We argue that our results are explained most simply by near-coastal sources rather than deep ocean sources at all periods. Although the dominant ambient noise sources are distributed inhomogeneously in azimuth, strong ambient noise emerges from most directions when using recordings that are 1 year in duration. Simulations illustrate that this is what ensures the accuracy of the empirical Green's functions and ambient noise tomography.},

abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging field of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency--time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be flexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a significant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

abstract = {We present the results of Rayleigh wave and Love wave phase velocity tomography in the western United States using ambient seismic noise observed at over 250 broad-band stations from the EarthScope/USArray Transportable Array and regional networks. All available three-component time-series for the 12-month span between 2005 November 1 and 2006 October 31 have been cross-correlated to yield estimated empirical Rayleigh and Love wave Green's functions. The Love wave signals were observed with higher average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than Rayleigh wave signals and hence cannot be fully explained by the scattering of Rayleigh waves. Phase velocity dispersion curves for both Rayleigh and Love waves between 5 and 40 speriod were measured for each interstation path by applying frequency--time analysis. The average uncertainty and systematic bias of the measurements are estimated using a method based on analysing thousands of nearly linearly aligned station-triplets. We find that empirical Green's functions can be estimated accurately from the negative time derivative of the symmetric component ambient noise cross-correlation without explicit knowledge of the source distribution. The average traveltime uncertainty is less than 1 s at periods shorter than 24 s. We present Rayleigh and Love wave phase speed maps at periods of 8, 12, 16,and 20 s. The maps show clear correlations with major geological structures and qualitative agreement with previous results based on Rayleigh wave group speeds.},

We compute cross-correlations of vertical component records of several days of seismic noise at different pairs of stations separated by distances from about one hundred to more than two thousand kilometers. Coherent broadband dispersive wavetrains clearly emerge with group velocities similar to those predicted from the global Rayleigh-wave tomographic maps that have been constrained using ballistic surface waves. Those results show that coherent Rayleigh waves can be extracted from the ambient seismic noise and that their dispersion characteristics can be measured in a broad range of periods. This provides a source for new types of surface-wave measurements that can be obtained for numerous paths that could not be sampled with the ballistic waves and, therefore, can significantly improve the resolution of seismic images.},

abstract = {Seismic interferometry involves the crosscorrelation of re- sponses at different receivers to obtain the Green’s function be- tween these receivers. For the simple situation of an impulsive plane wave propagating along the x-axis, the crosscorrelation of the responses at two receivers along the x-axis gives the Green’s function of the direct wave between these receivers. When the source function of the plane wave is a transient ?as in exploration seismology? or a noise signal ?as in passive seismology?, then the crosscorrelation gives the Green’s function, convolved with the autocorrelation of the source function. Direct-wave interferome- try also holds for 2D and 3D situations, assuming the receivers are surrounded by a uniform distribution of sources. In this case, the main contributions to the retrieved direct wave between the receivers come from sources in Fresnel zones around stationary points. The main application of direct-wave interferometry is the retrieval of seismic surface-wave responses from ambient noise and the subsequent tomographic determination of the surface- wavevelocity distribution of the subsurface. Seismic interferom- etry is not restricted to retrieving direct waves between receivers. In a classic paper, Claerbout shows that the autocorrelation of the transmission response of a layered medium gives the plane-wave reflection response of that medium.This is essentially1Dreflect- ed-wave interferometry. Similarly, the crosscorrelation of the transmission responses, observed at two receivers, of an arbitrary inhomogeneous medium gives the 3D reflection response of that medium.One of the main applications of reflected-wave interfer- ometry is retrieving the seismic reflection response from ambient noise and imaging of the reflectors in the subsurface.Acommon aspect of direct- and reflected-wave interferometry is that virtual sources are created at positions where there are only receivers without requiring knowledge of the subsurface medium parame- ters or of the positions of the actual sources.},

abstract = {Empirical Green's functions (EGFs) between pairs of seismographs can be estimated from the time derivative of the long-time cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise. These EGFs reveal velocity dispersion at relatively short periods, which can be used to resolve structures in the crust and uppermost mantle better than with traditional surface-wave tomography. We combine Rayleigh-wave dispersion estimates from EGFs and from traditional two-station (TS) analysis into a new approach to surface-wave array tomography with data from dense receiver arrays. We illustrate the methodology with continuous broad-band recordings from a temporary seismographic network on the southeastern part of the Tibetan plateau, in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, SW China. The EGFs are robust under temporal changes in regional seismicity and the use of either ambient noise (approximated by records without signal from events with magnitude mb[\&ge;] 5 or 4) or surface wave coda produces similar results. The EGFs do not strongly depend on the presence of large earthquakes, but they are not reciprocal for stations aligned in the N-S direction. This directionality reflects the paucity of seismicity to the north of the array. Using a far-field representation of the surface-wave Green's function and an image transformation technique, we infer from the EGFs the Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion in the period band from 10-30 s. A classical TS approach is used to determine Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion between 20-120 s. Together, they constrain phase velocity variations for T= 10-120 s, which can be used to study the structure from the crust to the upper mantle. Beneath SE Tibet, short and intermediate period (10-80 s) phase velocities are prominently low, suggesting that the crust and upper mantle beneath SE Tibet is characterized by slow shear wave propagation.},

abstract = {In this study, we analyze continuous data from all Global Seismographic Network stations between year 2000 and 2009 and demonstrate that several body wave phases (e.g., PP, PcPPKP, SKSP, and PPS) propagating between nearly antipodal station pairs can be clearly observed without array stacking using the noise/coda cross-correlation method. Based on temporal correlations with global seismicity, we show that the observed body waves are clearly earthquake related. Moreover, based on single-earthquake analysis, we show that the earthquake coda energy observed between \~{}10,000 and 30,000 s after a large earthquake contributes the majority of the signal. We refine our method based on these observations and show that the signal can be significantly improved by selecting only earthquake coda times. With our improved processing, the PKIKP phase, which does not benefit from the focusing effect near the antipode, can now also clearly be observed for long-distance station pairs.},

abstract = {Ambient seismic noise correlations are widely used for high-resolution surface-wave imaging of Earth’s lithosphere. Similar observations of the seismic body waves that propagate through the interior of Earth would provide a window into the deep Earth. We report the observation of the mantle transition zone through noise correlations of P waves as they are reflected by the discontinuities associated with the top [410 kliometers (km)] and the bottom (660 km) of this zone. Our data demonstrate that high-resolution mapping of the mantle transition zone is possible without using earthquake sources.},

@article{Claerbout1968,
abstract = {A direct (noniterative) method is presented to determine an acoustic layered medium from the seismogram due to a time-limited plane wave incident from the lower halfspace. It is shown that one side of the autocorrelation of the seismogram due to an impulsive source at depth is the seismogram due to an impulsive source on the surface. This transforms the problem to the acoustic reflections problem as solved by Kunetz. Both the deep source time function and the layering can be determined from a surface seismogram.},

@article{Yao2008,
abstract = {We determine the 3-D shear wave speed variations in the crust and upper mantle in the southeastern borderland of the Tibetan Plateau, SW China, with data from 25 temporary broad-band stations and one permanent station. Interstation Rayleigh wave (phase velocity) dispersion curves were obtained at periods from 10 to 50 s from empirical Green's function (EGF) derived from (ambient noise) interferometry and from 20 to 150 s from traditional two-station (TS) analysis. Here, we use these measurements to construct phase velocity maps (from 10 to 150 s, using the average interstation dispersion from the EGF and TS methods between 20 and 50 s) and estimate from them (with the Neighbourhood Algorithm) the 3-D wave speed variations and their uncertainty. The crust structure, parametrized in three layers, can be well resolved with a horizontal resolution about of 100 km or less. Because of the possible effect of mechanically weak layers on regional deformation, of particular interest is the existence and geometry of low (shear) velocity layers (LVLs). In some regions prominent LVLs occur in the middle crust, in others they may appear in the lower crust. In some cases the lateral transition of shear wave speed coincides with major fault zones. The spatial variation in strength and depth of crustal LVLs suggests that the 3-D geometry of weak layers is complex and that unhindered crustal flow over large regions may not occur. Consideration of such complexity may be the key to a better understanding of relative block motion and patterns of seismicity.},
