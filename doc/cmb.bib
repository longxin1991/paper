abstract = {The presence of an intermittent layer at the base of Earth's mantle with a maximum thickness near 40 kilometers and a compressional wave velocity depressed by ∼10 percent compared with that of the overlying mantle is most simply explained as the result of partial melt at this depth. Both the sharp upper boundary of this layer (<10 kilometers wide) and the apparent correlation with deep mantle upwelling are consistent with the presence of liquid in the lowermost mantle, implying that the bottom of the thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle may lie above its eutectic temperature. Such a partially molten zone would be expected to have enhanced thermal and chemical transport properties and may provide constraints on the geotherm and lateral variations in lowermost mantle temperature or mineralogy.},

@article{Neuberg1991,
abstract = {A number of deep earthquakes from the Fiji-Tonga region were used to study the properties of the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The investigation was restricted to an area with a diameter of only a few hundred kilometers at the CMB, the use of a cluster of neighboring events yielding redundant sampling and rather good resolution. The components of the investigation are: (i) a classical stacking procedure to search for additional reflectors near the CMB; (ii) a deconvolution of seismograms and a stack of the inferred reflector series for the same purpose; (iii) a matched filter method to determine PcP travel times and PcP/P amplitude ratios precisely; and (iv) a comparison with synthetic seismograms to check the consistency of derived travel-time residuals and PcP amplitude variations in the presence of CMB topography. While we do not see any additional reflector for epicentral distances around 35°, we detect by stacking seismograms recorded at 70° an additional phase which might be caused by a reflection from the top of D″. We show that PcP travel-time residuals must not be interpreted as being caused exclusively by CMB topography. An additional investigation of synthetics provides some constraints on dominant wavelengths and corresponding amplitudes of CMB undulations. For wavelengths of 50–400 km the elevation cannot exceed 2–3 km, if PcP is observed in this particular area.},

@article{Garnero2000,
abstract = {Recent seismological investigations reveal the presence of highly anomalous structures at the base of the mantle, modeled as patches ≤5–50 km thick having ultralow-velocities (−$\delta$VP∼10–20{\%}, −$\delta$VS∼10–50{\%}). Waveform modeling shows seismological data are compatible with the patches exhibiting a wide range of density increases, up to $\delta$$\rho$∼60{\%}, which can be ascribed to chemical contamination of the deep mantle by the core. Not all anomalies require lowermost mantle partial melting, and may be located just below or right at the core-mantle boundary (CMB): a ∼1–3 km thick zone of finite rigidity (crystallization?) at the top of the outer core or, more generally, of gradational properties across the CMB can also explain observations. Fuzzy patches at the boundary may be zones of intense chemical and physical interactions between the mantle and core.},

@article{Rost2003,
abstract = {Short-period, teleseismic ScP phases from events in the Tonga-Fiji region recorded at the short-period, small-aperture Warramunga Array in Australia are used to study structure at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We examine the data for evidence of precursors and postcursors to ScP. Such additional arrivals are generated by the interaction of ScP with structure at the reflection and conversion point at or near the CMB. We show precursors and postcursors to ScP, indicating an ultralow-velocity zone (ULVZ) at the CMB in the region between Tonga-Fiji and Australia. One-dimensional forward modeling of the short-period data leads to models of the ULVZ with thickness varying between 5 and 20 km, velocity reductions of 0–10{\%} and 10–30{\%} for P velocity and S velocity, respectively, and 0–50{\%} density increase. Many events, however, show simple waveforms, consistent with a locally simple CMB. Models for proximal events can vary greatly, indicating very complex, three-dimensional structure with scale lengths of a few tens of kilometers. These results point to complex chemical and physical processes in the lowermost mantle.},

@article{Revenaugh1997,
abstract = {Three source regions show evidence of a low-velocity layer that is less than 15 kilometers thick on top of the core-mantle boundary and require about a 3:1 ratio of shear-to-compressional velocity reduction, which is consistent with partial melt. Layer thickness is correlated with travel time residuals of the seismic phases that are most sensitive to the lowermost mantle velocity. These observations suggest that the layer is thinned beneath downwellings but is present everywhere along the core-mantle boundary. Low viscosity accompanying partial melt can localize the upwelling of warmed mantle, making the low-velocity layer a plausible source of mantle plumes.},
