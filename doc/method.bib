abstract = {By comparing records of the radial component of motion of teleseismic P waves to records of the vertical component, it is possible to identify S phases within the P wave form. These phases are generated by the mechanism of P to S conversion at discontinuities in velocity under the receiving station. Similar phases of the S to P converted type appear as precursors to the direct SV arrival. Models for the crustal structure can be tested by generating synthetic seismograms for both components of motion of both the P and SV waves and comparing with the data. The technique has been used to model the crustal structure at WWSSN stations CAR and COR. It has also been used to check a recently proposed model for the crustal structure in eastern Canada which contains a large low-shear-velocity zone at the base of the crust. This study indicates that the crustal structure in eastern Canada is highly non-uniform with perhaps few features common to the whole region. Finally, the technique is used to identify several stations in the WWSSN which appear to be located on highly anomalous structure.},

abstract = {We applied an integrated receiver function imaging technique to the teleseismic data from 54 NCISP-III broadband seismic stations to study the fine-scale crustal structure beneath the eastern Yanshan belt (YSB) and adjacent areas at the northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC). The robustness and reliability of the resultant crustal image were noticeably improved by achieving imaging consistency between common conversion point stacking and waveform inversion of the receiver functions. Our imaging result revealed substantial lateral heterogeneities in the crust of the study region, as displayed by the undulating intra-crustal interfaces, highly varying upper-, middle-, and lower crust thicknesses, and interlayers of low and high velocities. The crustal structure of the YSB is characterized by significant structural variations together with a sharp Moho, a thin-to-normal crust and a lower crust with lower velocity and normal thickness. It differs markedly from the Bohai Bay basin and the Taihang Mountains within the interior of the NCC. The distinct features and structural complexity of the YSB might be attributed to the complex tectonic history of the region, especially the multiple phases of contraction and possible occurrence of crustal delamination, which is in large contrast to other subregions of the NCC where tectonic extension likely dominated the crustal deformation since the late Mesozoic.},

The response of an inhomogeneous medium can be simulated by approximating the model by many thin homogeneous layers. This method is extended to allow the response of an inhomogeneous medium to be obtained directly. The technique can be adapted for a spherical stratified model using the Earth flattening transformation. It is shown that the seismogram of first order reflections is not exact even for the first motion. The result for the response of an inhomogeneous medium is sufficiently simple that the effect of model perturbations can be derived directly.},

abstract = {If the site at which receiver functions are constructed is filled by sediments, then the waveforms from these receiver functions are dominantly controlled by the sedimentary structures within the first few seconds after the direct P arrival. Based on this observation, waveform data collected at 44 temporary seismic stations have been used to image the sedimentary structure of the Bohai Bay Basin, a major continental petroliferous basin in Eastern China. An adapted hybrid global waveform inversion method was applied to the receiver functions to extract structural information beneath each of the stations. The derived S-velocity structure provides for the first time, a basin-scale seismic image of detailed sedimentary stratification. The sedimentary cover of the basin is about 2–12 km thick, consisting of Cenozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleozoic strata from top to bottom. The structural features presented in the S-velocity image coincide quite well with the depression–uplift type of tectonic system in the Bohai Bay Basin. The reconstructed morphology of the sedimentary layers provides seismological evidence for the two-stage evolution of the intracontinental basin that were caused by an intensive tectonic regime transition in late Mesozoic immediately following the lithospheric reforming of the Eastern China continent.},

abstract = {The antipodal region (178° ≤ $\Delta$ ≤ 180°) of a seismic wave source is investigated in detail and shown to provide a new set of remarkable data to use in the exploration of the earth's interior. Body and surface waves converge individually at antipodal distances after having sampled laterally the totality of the planet. The waves are focused and strongly amplified up to 1 order of magnitude with respect to the normal phase recorded 2° or more away. The delicate interference patterns thus formed yield information on departures from lateral homogeneity and sphericity of the core and mantle, the structure of the inner core, global dissipation characteristics of the upper mantle, and provide strong constraints on earth models. Seismograms have been synthesized that closely reproduce the phases Pdiff, PKIKP, PKIIKP, PKP(BC), PKP, and PP observed at World-Wide Standard Seismographic Network long-period instruments located within 5° from the antipode of the New Zealand Inangahua earthquake of May 23, 1968. Preliminary results indicate that the lower mantle and upper core are laterally homogeneous as seen by 15-s waves, but the core-mantle boundary region is probably laterally inhomogeneous. The inner core-outer core boundary appears to be a sharp transition with a P wave velocity jump of the order of 0.8 km/s. The resolution of the long-period data is poor, but the potential richness of the method when better data sets are available strongly motivated the investigation. Suggested future lines of research using antipodal observations include monitoring of inner core phases, study of focal processes of large earthquakes, and the exploration of planetary interiors.},

abstract = {We derive modified matrix operators that minimize the numerical error of solutions of the discretized elastic equation of motion. The criterion for obtaining the modified matrix operators is that the net error of the discretized equation of motion must be approximately equal to zero whenever the operand is an eigenfunction and the frequency is equal to the corresponding eigenfrequency. As it is not necessary to know the explicit values of the eigensolutions, our approach can be applied to arbitrarily heterogeneous media. In this paper we primarily consider frequency domain solutions calculated using the direct solution method (DSM) (Geller et al. 1990; Hara, Tsuboi \& Geller 1991; Geller \& Ohminato 1994). We present explicit formulations of the modified operators and numerical examples for P-SV and SH wave propagation in laterally homogeneous, isotropic media. The numerical solutions obtained using the modified operators are about 30 times more accurate than those obtained using the unmodified operators for the same CPU time. Our methods are readily applicable to problems in spherical coordinates or involving laterally heterogeneous media, as well as to time-domain solutions. It should also be possible to apply the methods of this paper to numerical methods other than the DSM.},

abstract = {We estimated the crustal thickness along an east-west transect across the Andes at lat 20°S and along a north-south transect along the eastern edge of the Altiplano from data recorded on two arrays of portable broadband seismic stations (BANJO and SEDA). Waveforms of deep regional events in the downgoing Nazca slab and teleseismic earthquakes were processed to isolate the P-to-S converted phases from the Moho in order to compute the crustal thickness. We found crustal-thickness variations of nearly 40 km across the Andes. Maximum crustal thicknesses of 70–74 km under the Western Cordillera and the Eastern Cordillera thin to 32–38 km 200 km east of the Andes in the Chaco Plain. The central Altiplano at 20°S has crustal thicknesses of 60 to 65 km. The crust also appears to thicken from north (16°S, 55–60 km) to south (20°S, 70–74 km) along the Eastern Cordillera. The Subandean zone crust has intermediate thicknesses of 43 to 47 km. Crustal-thickness predictions for the Andes based on Airy-type isostatic behavior show remarkable overall correlation with observed crustal thickness in the regions of high elevation. In contrast, at the boundary between the Eastern Cordillera and the Subandean zone and in the Chaco Plain, the crust is thinner than predicted, suggesting that the crust in these regions is supported in part by the flexural rigidity of a strong lithosphere. With additional constraints, we conclude that the observation of Airy-type isostasy is consistent with thickening associated with compressional shortening of a weak lithosphere squeezed between the stronger lithosphere of the subducting Nazca plate and the cratonic lithosphere of the Brazilian craton.},

abstract = {We analyzed tens of thousands of receiver-function data recorded by 185 broadband seismic stations to study the crustal structure beneath the northeast China. Moho depth and average crustal Vp/Vs ratio were measured at each station using the H–$\kappa$ grid searching technique. For stations located above unconsolidated sediments, we applied the H–$\beta$ method to remove strong shallow reverberations and generate subsurface receiver functions that allow for effective H–$\kappa$ analysis. The measurements show that the Songliao basin has a relatively thin crust (∼31 km), and the Moho depth increases significantly from southeast (∼27 km) to northwest (∼35 km). The northwestward tilting of the Songliao basin may suggest that it was initiated by lithospheric flexure due to the load of the Great Xing'an range in the Jurassic before the large-scale extension in the Cretaceous. Moho depth varies from 26.7 km to 42.3 km across the study area, with the shallowest and deepest Moho being located at the eastern flank of the Songliao basin and the Great Xing'an range, respectively. The Moho depth correlates well with the surface topography in the western part, but not the central and eastern parts of the study area. The residual topography computed based on the Airy's isostasy model indicates that the high topography at the eastern flank of the Songliao basin, the Changbaishan volcanic center, and the southern end of the Great Xing'an range is likely dynamically supported by the upper mantle.},

abstract = {Over the last three years, a major international effort has been made by the Sub-Commission on Earthquake Algorithms of the International Association of Seismology and the Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI) to generate new global traveltime tables for seismic phases to update the tables of Jeffreys \& Bullen (1940). The new tables are specifically designed for convenient computational use, with high-accuracy interpolation in both depth and range. The new iasp91 traveltime tables are derived from a radially stratified velocity model which has been constructed so that the times for the major seismic phases are consistent with the reported times for events in the catalogue of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) for the period 1964–1987. The baseline for the P-wave traveltimes in the iasp91 model has been adjusted to provide only a small bias in origin time for well-constrained events at the main nuclear testing sites around the world.For P-waves at teleseismic distances, the new tables are about 0.7s slower than the 1968 P-tables (Herrin 1968) and on average about 1.8-1.9 s faster than the Jeffreys \& Bullen (1940) tables. For S-waves the teleseismic times lie between those of the JB tables and the results of Randall (1971).Because the times for all phases are derived from the same velocity model, there is complete consistency between the traveltimes for different phases at different focal depths. The calculation scheme adopted for the new iasp91 tables is that proposed by Buland \& Chapman (1983). Tables of delay time as a function of slowness are stored for each traveltime branch, and interpolated using a specially designed tau spline which takes care of square-root singularities in the derivative of the traveltime curve at certain critical slownesses. With this representation, once the source depth is specified, it is straightforward to find the traveltime explicitly for a given epicentral distance. The computational cost is no higher than a conventional look-up table, but there is increased accuracy in constructing the traveltimes for a source at arbitrary depth. A further advantage over standard tables is that exactly the same procedure can be used for each phase. For a given source depth, it is therefore possible to generate very rapidly a comprehensive list of traveltimes and associated derivatives for the main seismic phases which could be observed at a given epicentral distance.},

abstract = {Fifteen seismic stations were operated with about 20-km spacing in southern Tibet across the Zangbo suture (the collision zone between India and Asia) between May and October 1994 as part of the International Deep Profiling of Tibet and the Himalaya project (INDEPTH II) for wide-angle recording of the controlled source experiment and for passive earthquake recording. In addition, a dense deployment (4-km spacing) of stations within the German Depth Profiling of Tibet and the Himalayas (GEDEPTH) project also recorded a number of teleseismic earthquakes. The third data source used in this study is the records of the permanent broadband station at Lhasa. Teleseismic records have been obtained in sufficient quantity and quality to derive an image of the structure of the lithosphere and upper mantle from P-to-S converted phases. Important results are as follows. The Moho at 70–80 km and a second discontinuity at 50–60 km depth are observed over the entire profile south and north of the Zangbo suture. The data from the GEDEPTH dense array enable the detection of inclined structures penetrating the crust at the Zangbo suture. A pronounced low-velocity zone exists north of the Zangbo suture at about 10–20 km depth. The locations of the upper mantle discontinuities at 410 and 660 km depth are in agreement with the global reference model IASP91 [Kennett, 1991] over a large region of the Himalaya and southern Tibet.},

abstract = {We have investigated crustal thickness and composition across the southeastern Caribbean plate boundary with the receiver function technique. We used teleseismic data recorded by a temporary broadband array deployed under the BOLIVAR project and the permanent national seismic network of Venezuela. We used the primary P-to-S conversion and crustal reverberations to estimate crustal thickness and average crustal VP/VS ratio over the region. We observe large variations in crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio. Estimated Moho depth ranges from ∼16 km beneath the southeastern Caribbean Sea to ∼52 km beneath northeastern Venezuela and the Venezuelan Andes. There is a good correlation between crustal structure and tectonic terranes. Data from the Precambrian Guayana Shield suggest that the underlying crustal structure is relatively uniform with a moderate thickness (∼37 km) and an intermediate composition. A thick crust is found below the foreland basins. The two mountain systems in northern Venezuela, the Serrania del Interior and the Serrania del Falcon, have a thin crust with arc composition and are likely dynamically supported by elastic rebound or underthrusting of the oceanic plateau that characterizes the southern Caribbean. On the other hand, the Venezuelan Andes and Perija Range on the western side of the country are probably isostatically balanced by thick crustal roots.},

abstract = {In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of receiver function data, it is typical to stack receiver functions calculated from events at similar distances and back azimuths. We have adapted the velocity spectrum stacking (VSS) technique, used extensively in reflection seismology, to the receiver function method in order to stack data with different ray parameters, thereby improving further the signal-to-noise ratio. Perhaps more importantly, by producing the velocity spectrum stacks we take advantage of the differences in the shapes of the moveout curves of converted phases and reverberations to identify and separate the various phases and to infer velocity structure. By comparison of velocity spectrum stacks produced from the observed data at the IRIS/IDA broad-band station at Obninsk, Russia (OBN) with those produced from PREM synthetics we have identified Ps phases from the 400 and 670 km discontinuities. The P-to-S (Ps) converted phase from the 400 km discontinuity observed at OBN is much larger, compared with that of the 670 km discontinuity, than is predicted by PREM. This suggests a higher velocity contrast at 400 km than in PREM. By adapting a bootstrap method to assess the depth and velocity estimates determined by VSS, we find that the Ps phase from the 670 km discontinuity is best imaged with higher than PREM upper mantle P and S velocities and at a depth of 663 ± 3 km. We find no evidence of a 220 km discontinuity beneath OBN in these data.},

abstract = {An automatic phase picker is useful for quickly identifying and timing phase arrivals in large seismic data bases. We have developed an automatic phase picker that is sensitive to small changes in amplitude and applied it to over 7 yr of global data distributed by the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC). Our phase-picking algorithm is based on a short-term-average to long-term-average ratio (STA/LTA) taken along an envelope function generated from the seismogram. The algorithm returns arrival times and corresponding pick qualities. The procedure requires few input parameters and is easily adapted to various types of data. We produce global travel-time plots from both high-frequency (20- or 40-Hz sample rate) and low-frequency (1-Hz sample rate) data. These plots clearly image the predominant high- and low-frequency phases in the NEIC data base. Picks made from the long-period seismograms are less precise, but they reveal far more phase arrivals than the short-period picks. A number of phases resulting from reflections and phase conversions at upper mantle discontinuities can be identified in the low-frequency picks; however, a search of the short-period picks for upper mantle discontinuity phases, between P and PP and prior to P′P′, has so far been unsuccessful. In the long-period S and SS picks, we observe a discrepancy in SV and SH travel times, a possible result of upper mantle anisotropy. To check the accuracy and consistency of our algorithm, we present comparisons between hand-picked times and automatic-picked times for identical seismograms. Travel-time residuals from the short-period automatic picks and data reported to the International Seismological Centre (ISC) picks exhibit a comparable amount of scatter. Histograms of the ISC residuals and automatic-pick residuals are similar in shape and width for P and PcP. These observations suggest that human picking errors are not a major contributor to the scatter observed in ISC travel times, although direct comparisons between ISC reported picks and automatic picks on particular seismograms occasionally identify operator mispicks.},

abstract = {Elastic wave scattering by a general elastic heterogeneity having slightly different density and elastic constants from the surrounding medium is formulated using the equivalent source method and Born approximation. In the low-frequency range (Rayleigh scattering) the scattered field by an arbitrary heterogeneity having an arbitrary variation of density and elastic constants can be equated to a radiation field from a point source composed of a unidirectional force proportional to the density contrast between the heterogeneity and the medium, and a force moment tensor proportional to the contrasts of elastic constant. It is also shown that the scattered field can be decomposed into an 'impedance-type' field, which has a main lobe in the backscattering direction and no scattering in the exact forward direction, and a 'velocity type' scattered field, which has a main lobe in the forward scattering direction and no scattering in the exact backward direction. For Mie scattering we show that the scattered far field is a product of two factors: (1) elastic Rayleigh scattering of a unit volume, and (2) a scalar wave scattering factor for the parameter variation function of the heterogeneity which we call 'volume factor.' For the latter we derive the analytic expressions for a uniform sphere and for a Gaussian heterogeneity. We show the relations between volume factors and the 3-D Fourier transform (or 1-D Fourier transform in the case of spherical symmetry) of the parameter variations of the heterogeneity. The scattering spatial pattern varies depending upon various combinations of density and elastic-constant perturbations. Some examples of scattering pattern are given to show the general characteristics of the elastic wave scattering.},

The Mohorovic˘i\'{c} discontinuity is treated as a layered transition zone. De Hoop's modification of Cagniard's method is used to obtain the exact transient response which is convolved with the source pulse shape and the instrumental system function to yield theoretical seismograms.When the boundary is an interface or a thin layered transition zone the head wave is a small pure refraction which is followed by a strong reflection. As the transition zone grows in thickness the head wave receives both refracted and reflected energy and becomes the dominant feature. These results compare favorably with observations made in the Bering Sea.This study suggests that the transition zone is thin, probably less than 1 km, in the Northern Aleutian Basin. Southward approaching the Aleutian Islands the transition zone thickens so that no major discontinuity exists between the crust and mantle.},

In addition, a dense deployment (4-km spacing) of stations within the German Depth Profiling of Tibet and the Himalayas (GEDEPTH) project also recorded a number of teleseismic earthquakes. The third data source used in this study is the records of the permanent broadband station at Lhasa. Teleseismic records have been obtained in sufficient quantity and quality to derive an image of the structure of the lithosphere and upper mantle from P-to-S converted phases. Important results are as follows. The Moho at 70–80 km and a second discontinuity at 50–60 km depth are observed over the entire profile south and north of the Zangbo suture. The data from the GEDEPTH dense array enable the detection of inclined structures penetrating the crust at the Zangbo suture. A pronounced low-velocity zone exists north of the Zangbo suture at about 10–20 km depth. The locations of the upper mantle discontinuities at 410 and 660 km depth are in agreement with the global reference model IASP91 [Kennett, 1991] over a large region of the Himalaya and southern Tibet.},

abstract = {High-frequency reflection and refraction seismograms for laterally variable multi-layered elastic media are computed by using the frequency domain elastic Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (KH) theory of Frazer and Sen. Both source and receiver wavefields are expanded in series of generalized rays and then elastic (KH) theory is applied to determine the coupling between each source ray and each receiver ray at each interface. The motion at the receiver is given as a series of integrals, one for each generalized ray. We use geometrical optics and plane wave reflection and transmission coefficients for rapid evaluation of the integrand. When the source or the receiver ray field has caustics on the surface of integration geometrical ray theory breaks down and this gives rise to singularities in the KH integrand. We repair this using methods suggested by Frazer and Sen. Examples of reflection seismograms for 2-D structures computed by elastic KH theory are shown. Those for a vertical fault scarp structure are compared with the seismograms obtained by physical modelling. Then OBS data obtained from the mid-America trench offshore Guatemala area are analysed by computing KH synthetics for a velocity model that has been proposed for that area. Our analysis indicates the existence of a small low-velocity zone off the trench axis. No head wave arrivals are obtained in our KH synthetics since we do not consider multiple interactions of a ray with an interface. The nearly discontinuous behaviour of elastic R/T coefficients near the critical angle causes small spurious phases which arrive later than the correct arrivals.},

abstract = {A geometrical ray method is developed for wave calculations involving three-dimensional planar dipping interfaces. Justification for the method is based on analogy with first-motion approximations derived from generalized ray theory where frequency dependence in the reflection-transmission coefficients is related to changes in the complex ray parameter. The method is applied to finding the teleseismic response of an arbitrarily oriented dislocation source in dipping layered media and for receiver calculations which assume an impinging P or S wave beneath a stack of dipping layers. Source results indicate that wave forms from fast azimuthally varying sources, such as strike-slip faults, are significantly distorted from the plane layered case for simple structures. A simple dipping Moho for dips up to 10° does not significantly distort vertical and radial P waves for the receiver response. However, due to azimuth anomalies introduced by interface dip a significant tangential P component is produced. In addition, the S-wave response becomes a function of source mechanism due to the need for specifying the incident polarization angle. Polarization studies are suggested for finding dipping structure.},

abstract = {Analysis of a deployment of broadband sensors along a 500-km-long line crossing the Yellowstone hotspot track (YHT) has provided 423 in-plane receiver functions with which to image lateral variations in mantle discontinuity structure. Imaging is accomplished by performing the converted wave equivalent of a common midpoint stack, which significantly improves resolution of mantle discontinuity structure with respect to single-station stacks. Timing corrections are calculated from locally derived tomographic P and S wave velocity images and applied to the Pds (where d is the depth of the conversion) ray set in order to isolate true discontinuity topography. Using the one-dimensional TNA velocity model and a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.82 to map our Pds times to depth, the average depths of the 410- and 660-km discontinuities are 423 and 664 km, respectively, giving an average transition zone thickness of 241 km. Our most robust observation is provided by comparing the stack of all NW back-azimuth arrivals versus all SE back-azimuth arrivals. This shows that the transition zone thickness varies between 261 and 232 km, between the NW and SE portions of our line. More spatially resolved images show that this transition zone thickness variation results from the occurrence of 20–30 km of topography over 200–300 lateral scale lengths on the 410- and 660-km discontinuities. The topography on the 410- and 660-km discontinuities is not correlated either positively or negatively beneath the 600-km-long transect, albeit correlation could be present for wavelengths larger than the length of our transect. If this discontinuity topography is controlled exclusively by thermal effects, then uncorrelated 250° lateral temperature variations are required at the 410- and 660-km discontinuities. However, other sources of discontinuity topography such as the effects of garnet-pyroxene phase transformations, chemical layering, or variations in mantle hydration may contribute. The most obvious correlation between the discontinuity structure and the track of the Yellowstone hotspot is the downward dip of the 410-km discontinuity from 415 km beneath the NW margin of the YHT to 435 km beneath the easternmost extent of Basin and Range faulting. Assuming this topography is thermally controlled, the warmest mantle resides not beneath the Yellowstone hotspot track, but 150 km to the SE along the easternmost edge of the active Basin and Range faulting.},

abstract = {Teleseismic long-period P waves recorded at the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network station LON (Longmire, Washington) are shown to exhibit strong anomalous particle motion not attributable to instrument miscalibration or malfunction. In particular, a large and azimuthally smoothly varying tangential component is observed after vector rotation of horizontal P waves into the ray direction and after application of a deconvolution technique which equalizes effective source time functions and removes the instrument response. These tangential waves attain amplitudes comparable to the radial component and demonstrate wave form antisymmetry about a NNE azimuth. A model which contains a single high-contrast interface dipping toward the NNE at a depth of 15–20 km can explain most of the characteristics of the long-period P wave data, provided dips are greater than about 10° and only the interference of P and Ps generated at the interface is considered. The model breaks down for later arrivals which are presumably multiples or scattered waves. Examination of long-period S waves from several deep teleseisms shows a prominent Sp arrival 18 s before S. The timing of this phase conversion suggests an interface at about 145-km depth, and its sense of polarity suggests that the velocity contrast is from higher to lower velocities as depth decreases. This interface may correspond to the bottom of the upper mantle low-velocity zone in the area.},

The detailed broadband receiver functions are obtained by stacking source-equalized horizontal components of teleseismic P waveforms. The resulting receiver functions are most sensitive to the shear velocity structure near the station. A time domain inversion routine utilizes the radial receiver function to determine this structure assuming a crustal model parameterized by many thin, flat-lying, homogeneous layers. Lateral changes in structure are identified by examining azimuthal variations in the vertical structure. The results reveal significant rapid lateral changes in the midcrustal structure beneath the station that are interpreted in relation to the origin of the East Continent Gravity High located northeast of RSCP. The results from events arriving from the northeast show a high-velocity midcrustal layer not present in results from the southeast azimuth. This velocity structure can be shown to support the idea that this feature is part of a Keweenawan rift system. Another interesting feature of the derived velocity models is the indication that the crust-mantle boundary beneath the Cumberland Plateau is a thick, probably laminated transition zone between the depths of 40 and 55 km, a result consistent with interpretations of early refraction work in the area.},

Our teleseismic waveform modeling technique involves inverting the radial component of stacked source-equalized receiver functions in the time domain to estimate the vertical shear velocity structure at the site. The receiver functions at RSNY (Adirondacks, New York), RSON (Red Lake, Ontario), and RSNT (Yellowknife, Northwest Territory) are quite simple compared to previously published RSCP (Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee) data, largely due to the absence of sedimentary surface rocks at these sites. At RSNY, a high-velocity layer at mid-crustal depths (18 to 26 km) in our southeast backazimuth results correlates in depth with a zone of high-amplitude reflections found on COCORP profiles 60 km south of RSNY. A gradational crust-mantle boundary is observed at RSCP and RSNY. The RSON and RSNT sites are characterized by simple crusts with fairly abrupt crust-mantle boundaries. The crust beneath RSON appears to have a clear division between the upper and lower crust at about 18 km depth while this boundary is not well-developed at RSNT. Pronounced azimuthal variations in crustal structure at RSSD (Black Hills, South Dakota) prohibit the determination of velocity using a layered earth model. The crustal thicknesses at each of these sites are: RSCP, 40 to 50 km; RSSD, 47 to 50 km; RSNY, 45 to 50 km; RSNT, 38 km; and RSON, 42 km.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for calculating synthetic seismograms and their partial derivatives for laterally and vertically heterogeneous media with arbitrary natural boundary conditions. The formulation is derived by adding appropriate surface integrals to the weak form (Galerkin formulation) of the elastic equation of motion to enforce the natural boundary and continuity conditions, and inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Results applicable to media consisting of a combination of fluid and solid regions are presented. The method is called the Direct Solution Method (DSM) (Geller et al. 1990c) because the synthetic seismograms and partial derivatives are computed directly by solving a system of linear equations. In contrast, almost all previous applications of Galerkin methods in seismology have first computed the modes of free oscillation, and only then computed the synthetic seismograms and partial derivatives by summing the modes. As an example of the application of our method, we calculate synthetic seismograms for heterogeneous media which are terminated at the bottom by a thin homogeneous layer with a radiation (energy-absorbing) boundary condition.This method is well suited to computing the quantities necessary to perform linearized inversion for earth structure with respect to a laterally heterogeneous earth model (Geller \& Hara 1993). It thus becomes possible to formulate iterative linearized waveform inversion for laterally heterogeneous earth structure on a local and regional scale following the same basic approach used by Hara, Tsuboi \& Geller (1993) to invert waveform data for global laterally heterogeneous structure.},

abstract = {Analysis of mantle discontinuity structure using converted P to S (PaS) phases beneath Colorado from the Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL) Rocky Mountain Front (RMF) experiment reveals significant topography at the 410 and 660 km depth discontinuities and corresponding transition zone thickness variations. A stack of all radial receiver functions resolves the 410 and 660 km discontinuities at average depths of 419 and 677 km, respectively. Imaging of lateral variations in mantle discontinuity structure is accomplished by geographically binning the Pds conversion points and then stacking the receiver functions in each bin to form spatial images, analogous to common depth point stacking. Corrections for lateral velocity heterogeneity are calculated using the local S wave tomographic model of Lee and Grand [1996] and a constant ∂lnVs/∂lnVP scaling of 1.3. This scaling value is determined from the relative scaling between teleseismic P and S wave travel time residuals measured from the Rocky Mountain Front deployment. Mantle discontinuity images using 150 km square bins show 20 km of 410 km discontinuity topography, 30 km of 660 km discontinuity topography, and up to 40 km of transition zone thickness variation. Features of the discontinuity structure include a 20 km depression of the 660 km discontinuity beneath western Colorado and a gradual 10 km dip of the 410 km discontinuity beneath the High Plains. The thickening of the transition zone beneath southwest Colorado is consistent with the presence of the subducted Farallon slab in this region as imaged by Van der Lee and Nolet [1997]. In general, our results show that the transition zone discontinuity structure is more complex than that predicted by the simple model of olivine phase boundaries modulated by vertically coherent thermal anomalies.},

abstract = {Crust and mantle discontinuities across the eastern margin of the North American craton were imaged using P to S converted phase receiver functions recorded by the Missouri to Massachusetts Broadband Seismometer Experiment. Crustal structure constrained by modeling Moho conversions and reverberations shows a variation of Moho depth from a minimum of 30 km near the Atlantic coast to depths of 44–49 km beneath the western Appalachian Province and 38–45 km beneath the Proterozoic terranes in the west. The variation in crustal thickness is substantially greater than that required for local isostasy, unless lower crustal densities are >3110 kg/m3. In the upper mantle, Ps phases corresponding to a discontinuity at depths of 270–280 km were clearly observed beneath the eastern half of the array. Beneath the western third of the array, the receiver function stacks indicate more complex scattering, but weak Ps phases may be generated at depths of roughly 320 km. The transition between these two regions occurs across the eastern edge of the North American lithospheric keel imaged by tomography. The observed phases may be interpreted as conversions from the base of a low-velocity asthenosphere.},

abstract = {Long-period P waves from distant earthquakes have been analyzed from seismograms recorded at Albuquerque and Bermuda in the light of Haskel's theory of the spectral response of a layered crust. By using the ratio of the vertical spectrum to the horizontal component spectrum, we obtain a function which depends on structure beneath the station. Because of the poorly understood nature of the signal which follows the first P wave motion, the methods of power spectrum analysis are applied and a lag window selected to discriminate against long time correlations within the signal. Corrections for the differing responses of the three components are made by using the power spectral matrix of calibration signals. A range of crustal models has been found which agrees with the data. We are restricted primarily in choosing models for the lower half of the crust; variations of structure in the upper half do not noticeably affect the theoretical curves in the period range considered (0.02 to 0.20 cps). At Albuquerque the crust is about 40 km thick and the lower crust has velocities in the range 6.6 to 7.0 km/sec. The Mohorovicic (M) discontinuity under Bermuda is 12 km below sea level, and the structure appears to be a normal oceanic crust depressed elastically by the weight of the volcanics which compose the island.},

abstract = {We use the stationarity of the Fermat ray path to develop theoretical expressions that relate small, aspherical perturbations in velocity to small perturbations in travel times. For the Earth's ellipticity of figure we derive a compact expression for the perturbation in travel time. If the ellipticity is hydrostatic and is the dominant perturbation, then anomalies in travel times are linear constraints on the radial gradient of velocity. Otherwise, the anomalies are constraints on the (unknown) aspherical perturbations. We are led to an inverse problem in either case.Using recently derived models of the Earth we present calculations of the effect of ellipticity. If the effect of focal depth is neglected in the calculations, then mislocations in both epicentre and origin time can result. Differences between our calculations and those predicted by the approximate formula $\delta$t = (h+H)f($\Delta$) are as large as 0–25 s for P at 90°. Nowadays, seismologists are prone to attach significance to anomalies as small as 0.10 s. Consequently, we advocate that the effect of focal depth be considered and that traditional approximations be replaced by the more accurate calculations tabulated in this report.},

abstract = {The number of broadband three-component seismic stations in southern California has more than tripled recently. In this study we use the teleseismic receiver function technique to determine the crustal thicknesses and Vp/Vs ratios for these stations and map out the lateral variation of Moho depth under southern California. It is shown that a receiver function can provide a very good “point” measurement of crustal thickness under a broadband station and is not sensitive to crustal P velocity. However, the crustal thickness estimated only from the delay time of the Moho P-to-S converted phase trades off strongly with the crustal Vp/Vs ratio. The ambiguity can be reduced significantly by incorporating the later multiple converted phases, namely, the PpPs and PpSs+PsPs. We propose a stacking algorithm which sums the amplitudes of receiver function at the predicted arrival times of these phases by different crustal thicknesses H and Vp/Vs ratios. This transforms the time domain receiver functions directly into the H-Vp/Vs domain without need to identify these phases and to pick their arrival times. The best estimations of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio are found when the three phases are stacked coherently. By stacking receiver functions from different distances and directions, effects of lateral structural variation are suppressed, and an average crustal model is obtained. Applying this technique to 84 digital broadband stations in southern California reveals that the Moho depth is 29 km on average and varies from 21 to 37 km. Deeper Mohos are found under the eastern Transverse Range, the Peninsular Range, and the Sierra Nevada Range. The central Transverse Range, however, does not have a crustal root. Thin crusts exist in the Inner California Borderland (21–22 km) and the Salton Trough (22 km). The Moho is relatively flat at the average depth in the western and central Mojave Desert and becomes shallower to the east under the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ). Southern California crust has an average Vp/Vs ratio of 1.78, with higher ratios of 1.8 to 1.85 in the mountain ranges with Mesozoic basement and lower ratios in the Mojave Block except for the ECSZ, where the ratio increases.},

abstract = {The receiver function method (RFM) is a commonly used technique to study the crustal and upper mantle velocity structure. Early receiver function (RF) investigations were performed mostly at individual permanent stations. They were focused on crustal structures, and later on upper mantle velocity discontinuities (410 km and 660 km discontinuities). Only recently has research been directed towards the study of the lateral (2- and 3-D) variability of major velocity boundaries in the crust and upper mantle by receiver function arrays using temporary and permanent, three-component, short-period and broad-band seismic stations. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, receiver functions are calculated for individual earthquakes and are then binned, moveout corrected and stacked. We show that this processing sequence is similar to that applied routinely in exploration seismology. Therefore, existing tools from the nearvertical data processing can be adopted for receiver functions: velocity analysis tools, solutions for static and residual static problems, coherence enhancement of seismic phases, migration, etc. The high spatial density of seismic stations of recent and future receiver function experiments provides the opportunity (and obligation) to use the more sophisticated migration methods (full wavefield migration) commonly and successfully used in exploration seismics. paraSynthetics calculated by the finite difference method for simple 2-D crustal models are employed here to test our processing approach and to show the potentials and limitations of stacking and migrating RF data. We show that binning, normal moveout (NMO) corrections, stacking and post-stack migration of the synthetic data can reconstruct the models reliably with a high spatial resolution.},

We present the results of more than 235 waveform inversions for one-dimensional velocity structures that indicate that the primary sensitivity of a receiver function is to high wavenumber velocity changes, and a depth-velocity product, not simply velocity. The range of slownesses in a typical receiver function study does not appear to be broad enough to remove the depth-velocity ambiguity; the inclusion of a priori information is necessary. We also present inversion results for station RSCP, located in the Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee. Our results are similar to those from a previous study by Owens et al.

Results based on a modified receiver function waveform analysis of Moho conversions and crustal reverberation phases show that the crust beneath the array is thin (35.4 km) with an average Poisson’s ratio of 0.254. The minimum S-wave velocity contrast across the Moho is 17.3\% while the contrast in density is 15.4\%. The density contrast across the Moho is particularly diagnostic. For an assumed uppermost mantle density beneath Kimberley of 3.3 gm/cc as determined from mantle xenoliths, the density of the lowermost crust is 2.86 gm/cc, indicating rocks of felsic to intermediate composition. Analysis of waveform broadening of the crustal reverberation phases relative to that of the direct P-wave shows the thickness of the Moho transition zone to be less than 0.5 km and the maximum variation in crustal thickness over the region of the array to be less than 1 km. The flat and almost perfectly sharp Moho, together with the absence of a mafic lower crust, suggests large-scale crustal reworking in the period between crustal formation and the time of cratonic stabilization.},

Numerical seismograms of ground displacement in the range 10–100 km are constructed for a number of different crustal models and source descriptions. The results for shallow events show severe wave form modifications at epicentral distances as small as twice the source depth when models contain soft surface layers. A comparison of synthetic seismograms with observations from a central California earthquake of magnitude 4.6 indicates a moment of 2.1×1022 ergs with a faulting duration of 0.5 s. This moment is noticeably smaller than that estimated from the low frequency level of the whole seismogram spectrum assuming the usual homogeneous half-space model. This occurs because the energy arriving with the surface waves and deep crustal reflections boosts the long period portion of the spectrum, giving the impression of an anomalously large moment when calculated in the conventional manner. The close agreement between synthetic results and the actual data both in the time and in the Fourier transform domain suggests that our deterministic approach can be quite useful in understanding the complexity of seismograms recorded in the local field.},

abstract = {The known failure of classical ray theory at caustics has led to a reconsideration of displacement (in the frequency domain), expressed as an integral over ray parameter p. The integrand contains saddle-points on the real p-axis which correspond to rays for the associated physical problem, and it is shown here that direct computation of the complex integral is still straightforward, even when two saddle-points (rays) have coalesced to form a caustic. WKBJ theory is still usable for the vertical wave-functions, but one may avoid both the Taylor series expansion for the phase, and the steepest-descents approximation. Attention is first directed towards the PKKP caustic near 119°, to calculations of both amplitude and the phase slowness (dT/d$\Delta$) as a function of frequency, and to a criticism of some uses of plane wave reflection coefficients across the core-mantle boundary. It is then shown that short-period P-wave energy is efficiently tunnelled into and out of the Earth's core, from body waves having their turning point just above the core-mantle boundary. This provides an explanation for observations of multiply reflected core phases, PmKP with m > 2, which are found usually at distances beyond the cutoff one would expect from requiring real angles of incidence (≤ 90°) from mantle to core. To obtain body wave pulse shapes in the time domain, a method is described which appears to offer some strong advantages over Cagniard-de Hoop inversion.},

@article{Kind1995,
abstract = {Several years of broad-band teleseismic data from the GRSN stations have been analysed for crustal structure using P-to-S converted waves at the crustal discontinuities. An inversion technique was developed which applies the Thomson-Haskell formalism for plane waves without slowness integration. The main phases observed are Moho conversions, their multiples in the crust, and conversions at the base of the sediments. The crustal thickness derived from these data is in good agreement with results from other studies. For the Gr\"{a}fenberg stations, we have made a more detailed comparison of our model with a previously published model obtained from refraction seismic experiments. The refraction seismic model contains boundaries with strong velocity contrasts and a significant low-velocity zone, resulting in teleseismic waveforms that are too complicated as compared to the observed simple waveforms. The comparison suggests that a significant low-velocity zone is not required and that internal crustal boundaries are rather smooth.},

@article{Kind1996,
abstract = {Earthquake data collected by the INDEPTH-II Passive-Source Experiment show that there is a substantial south to north variation in the velocity structure of the crust beneath southern Tibet. North of the Zangbo suture, beneath the southern Lhasa block, a midcrustal low-velocity zone is revealed by inversion of receiver functions, Rayleigh-wave phase velocities, and modeling of the radial component of teleseismic P-waveforms. Conversely, to the south beneath the Tethyan Himalaya, no low-velocity zone was observed. The presence of the midcrustal low-velocity zone in the north implies that a partially molten layer is in the middle crust beneath the northern Yadong-Gulu rift and possibly much of southern Tibet.},

abstract = {Teleseismic P waveforms contain lots of information related to P-S phase and multiples generated at the interfaces of the crustal and upper mantle, based on the data obtained from the temporary and permanent, three-component, short-period and broad-band seismic stations, the resulting receiver function method is a commonly used technique to study the crustal and upper mantle velocity structure. This method can not only evaluate the velocity distribution below the receiver station from the waveform inversion, but also search the interfaces of the crust and the upper mantle after the superimposition of the receiver function traces. The receiver functions methods are most sensitive to the shear velocity structure near the station, gross lateral variations in structure may be obtained by examining the variation in vertical velocity distribution azimuthally around the station. The receiver function method is simple and easy to implement. Besides, it has the high resolution power with the high-density deployment of the broadband flowing seismic array. This paper overviews the evolvement of the receiver function over the recent 20 years and presents some results using this method, and in the end we argues about some tendency in the study of the method.},
